    - Fifty Shades of Gangrene
    - '<p><span class="first_letter">I</span> woke up in a motel room I''d never seen.
      No matter how hard I''ve thought about it since, I have no memory of how I got
      there or what happened the night before.</p><p>There were beer bottles all over
      the side table, not to mention a completely empty eighth of Jack Daniels. What
      looked like some kind of fancy foreign wine bottle, also drained, was filled
      with cigarette butts. The TV, one of those old boxy sets, had fallen back against
      the wall, and in the corner an arm chair was lying on its side. Feathers were
      everywhere; one of the pillows had been torn open.</p><p>I was pretty sure I
      was alone. No one was in bed with me. When I leaned over to check the floor
      I saw only more feathers and more beer bottles scattered across the carpet&mdash;along
      with my clothes. All of them. My jeans were in a pile against the wall with
      my underwear still bunched inside. My bra hung over the one arm chair that was
      still standing.</p><p>I was totally naked. And I''d definitely had sex. I was
      sore, and not just a little. I hadn''t felt like this since Shawn and I were
      in high school and going at it like rabbits senior year.</p><p>But we hadn''t
      had sex in months, as far as I could remember.</p><p>I tried not to think about
      the fact that there was no good reason I would have needed to check into a motel
      if it was my husband I''d had sex with.</p><p>And yet despite my fear about
      whatever it was I''d done that night, and despite my apparent blackout, and
      the pervasive smell of stale cigarettes&mdash;and some other smell too, I noticed
      now, something faintly rancid&mdash;I felt, well . . . <i>great</i>.</p><p>It
      was as if I''d been sleeping for days and had woken up completely refreshed.
      I didn''t have the slightest headache, not a hint of nausea. I practically bounced
      out of bed. When I pulled on my pants I felt like I had the energy to race up
      a mountain.</p><p>But I still couldn''t remember anything.</p><p>Other than
      the bottles everywhere, there was no evidence of whoever else had been with
      me in the room. The only clothes I''d found on the floor had been mine, and
      the bathroom was empty. All that was in the mini-bar fridge, weirdly, was an
      empty gallon milk container.<p><p>I looked under the bed and checked my pockets,
      but I couldn''t find my phone. So I couldn''t even look at my recent calls.
      Had I lost it, or had someone stolen it? I had no idea.</p><p>It was a beautiful
      day outside, but when I stepped into what I recognized now as the parking lot
      of the Starlight Motel, I realized that it wasn''t morning. The sun was already
      starting to set. Apparently I''d slept all afternoon.</p><p>Now that I was out
      in the fresh air, things started to come back to me about the day before, if
      not the night.</p> <p>Suddenly I remembered what Ian and I had found at the
      high school.</p><p>I remembered how I''d helped carry it. I remembered the stench,
      and how afterward I couldn''t quite wash off the smell. I wondered if maybe
      that''s what I''d been smelling inside the motel room.</p><p>I also remembered
      why my car was nowhere to be seen. I live in Muldoon, Colorado, and if you haven''t
      heard of it, you''re basically like everybody else in the world who isn''t from
      Muldoon. We don''t even have a stop light. It''s that small. The only thing
      that ever happens is the fair, once a year. The kids sell their livestock, there''s
      a carnival and a rodeo, and everyone pretty much has an excuse to get drunk
      all weekend.</p><p>I do the books at this trucking company whose office is right
      across from the fairgrounds. I usually park in the lot there, and when I got
      off work early yesterday there was this huge bus blocking my car. It was emblazoned
      with a massive <i>Bryce Tripp</i> logo. He''s supposed to be this up-and-coming
      country star, but, honestly, I hadn''t heard of him before a few days ago. (How
      big could he really be if he was giving a concert at the Muldoon fair?) The
      people in charge of his bus must have been waiting to get into the rodeo grounds
      where his concert was going to be, but I couldn''t find the driver anywhere.
      I couldn''t even reach my husband because the cell phones were already jammed
      from everyone arriving from out of town.</p><p>So I''d asked my boss for a ride
      home; I remembered now. I''d figured I''d worry about my car later. I hadn''t
      really needed it anyway then because Ian, my brother in law, was supposed to
      give me and Shawn a ride to the fair that night so we could drink, then he was
      going to bring us home later.</p><p>That had been the plan anyway.</p><p/>Now
      I was at the Starlight Motel, alone, without a car or phone, and still no memory
      at all of how I got there</p> <br><p><span class="new_section_first_letter">I</span>
      tried to go back and piece together everything that had happened the previous
      day as best as I could. </p><p>First, I remembered that when my boss dropped
      me at home, Shawn was already there, watching TV, as usual. His station at the
      couch was pretty much the only place he spent time lately when he wasn''t at
      work. He has a shift at the mill, which I know can be exhausting, but it''d
      been months since he''d been out. And lately he''d started saying he didn''t
      want me to go out with any of my friends alone. One of the reasons I''d been
      looking forward to the fair for weeks was that Shawn wouldn''t have any choice
      but to get off his ass and go somewhere. I''d been hoping that maybe we could
      have a little fun again, for once.</p><p>"I''m getting in the shower," I called
      out, competing with the blare of Sports Center. "Ian''s gonna be here in an
      hour, remember?"</p><p>After a moment, Shawn yelled back. </p><p>"Tonight? We''ll
      go tomorrow," he said. "No one really shows up until Saturday anyway."</p><p>I
      should have seen this coming. If my husband never wanted to go out at all anymore,
      why would he ever go out for two nights in a row without complaining about it?
      I''d thought things would be different during fair, but I guess I''d been wrong.</p><p>I
      tried not to sound too irritated. "Everyone always goes tonight." I leaned into
      the living room and found myself talking to the back of my husband''s head.
      He was only twenty-six, but his hair was just beginning to thin. "All your friends
      are going. And mine. Morgan''s already there waiting for me. And Ian''s coming
      all the way back in the middle of Tyler''s football game just to give us a ride.
      It would be weird if you didn''t go."</p><p>I stepped into the bathroom and
      turned on the shower before Shawn could respond. I hoped that by putting myself
      out of earshot he would give up and agree to just go without a fight. </p><p>While
      I undressed, I forced myself to look at the mirror. I''d definitely put on a
      little weight since high school, but not as much as Shawn had, especially after
      his accident. But I looked okay, I decided. Nothing like Morgan, who''d somehow
      stayed as skinny as she was at sixteen. But at least I looked okay. </p><p>While
      the water warmed up, without really meaning to, I started considering what my
      night out would be like if Shawn <i>did </i>just stay at home. I thought about
      having the chance to ride into town with Ian alone. I thought about doing shots
      with Morgan, just the two of us. Maybe it wouldn''t have been the worst thing
      after all if Shawn didn''t come. In the middle of washing my hair, I actually
      started seriously considered persuading him to stay home. </p><p>But by the
      time I got out of the shower I could hear him changing from his work clothes,
      and I decided not to say anything. I couldn''t. Not after I''d already talked
      him into going. I''d feel too guilty if I did something like that, anyway. Besides,
      it would probably be good for us to get drunk together. </p><p>Ian pulled up
      to the house just as I was finishing with my makeup. I wore this new low-cut
      top I''d bought just for the fair and my tightest pair of jeans. Maybe it wasn''t
      exactly what they were wearing in Denver these days, but not bad for the Muldoon
      fair. </p><p>I could tell my brother-in-law was in a hurry to get back before
      the end of the high school football game, but he was too polite to say so. As
      we came out of the house Ian kept his truck idling, sauntered over to Shawn,
      and slapped his shoulder.</p><p>"Hey, buddy, you all ready for tonight?"</p><p>"Yup,"
      Shawn said. As always, Shawn was a little quiet and intimidated by Ian. "Ready
      to go."</p><p>"Hiya, sis!" Ian gave me a quick hug, then just as quickly he
      let me go and hopped back into his pickup. </p><p>Ian was in a good mood. On
      the way over he told us that Tyler got a touchdown, and besides being happy
      that his son had played well, he was looking forward to being out at the fair
      tonight too. I could tell. </p><p>"You sure you''re okay not drinking?" I asked
      him. "I''m glad I''m not the one stuck driving." </p><p>I was glad Ian had offered
      to give us a ride, but the truth is I also liked how Ian got after a couple
      drinks. He''d been a medic in Iraq, and now he worked as an EMT at our tiny
      local hospital. When he got back from the war I used to worry he''d break down
      or something if he drank, but he never did. Mostly he just got less serious
      and his sense of humor would come out. I''d laugh at his wry jokes, and he always
      laughed along with me in this kind and warmly boyish way he had. He''s actually
      really attractive&mdash;way more attractive than Shawn&mdash;but sometimes I
      think my sister doesn''t even realize this.</p><p>"Who says I can''t have a
      beer?" Ian winked at me. "It''s fair time. I''ll nurse one for a little while."
      He nudged Shawn''s arm. "Just don''t tell Danielle."</p><p>I knew Ian really
      wouldn''t have any more than one drink. I don''t think I know anyone who''s
      more responsible. Besides, if he did, my sister would find out one way or another
      and kill him. </p><p>I was about to ask whether he was taking Haley, his youngest,
      to the carnival tonight, but that''s when Ian''s phone rang.</p><p>The gruff,
      semi-garbled voice on the speakerphone must have been a hospital dispatcher,
      but I couldn''t make out who it was. "Ian, you there at the school?" the voice
      asked. </p><p>"Just left," Ian said.</p><p>"I guess someone had a fall in the
      girl''s shower, or something. We just got a call from Bernice, but couldn''t
      quite make out what she was saying. The ambulance is still here at the hospital.
      We''re wrapping up Toby''s ankle now."</p><p>Ian switched off the speaker and
      brought the phone to his ear. "Yeah, I''ll be there in a couple minutes." </p><p>He
      hung up.</p><p>"That Toby Hollis kid sprained his ankle pretty bad in the first
      quarter," he told us. "Ambulance is still tied up wit him. You don''t mind if
      we make a little detour, do you? It''s probably nothing, but I gotta check it
      out."</p><p>"That''s alright," I said. </p><p>But in truth I was feeling selfish
      and a little disappointed that Ian couldn''t just drop us at the fairgrounds.
      What kind of town only had one ambulance? I guess Ian''s SUV was the sole backup.
      </p><p>Ian pulled right up to the door of the girl''s locker room. The second
      half of the football game had already started. I could hear the hum of the crowd
      over at the field, but the gym was deserted. Shawn stepped from the pickup,
      but in an old high-school habit he was hesitant about going into the girls''
      locker room, which I thought was kind of sadly funny, as if he were still just
      a kid. </p><p>Ian was in a hurry. "Come on in, if you want," he told us. "We''re
      a little understaffed." He laughed. "Maybe you could give me a hand, if I need
      it."</p><p>I hadn''t stepped into the locker room for years. Bernice Whipple,
      my old P.E. teacher, was even there. It was like she lived there. </p><p>"Hey,
      Mrs. Whipple." I gave her my best version of a friendly wave. But she didn''t
      even register my presence. </p><p>She was distraught, expressionless. She went
      right for Ian. She grabbed his jacket, then she led him toward the showers.</p><p>"Here,"
      she said, whispering. "Here. It''s here."</p><p>I followed behind, trying to
      stay out of the way.</p><p>When I first saw what was on the tile floor&mdash;the
      same place I''d stood showering a hundred times in high school&mdash;I thought
      maybe some kid was playing a joke, trying to scare the cheerleaders or something.
      </p><p>There were shards of broken glass all over the shower, and, right above,
      one of the big frosted windows had been broken out. </p><p>There wasn''t any
      blood. Just a person, naked, face down. It wasn''t a high-schooler at all, but
      a grown man, his bare ass in the air, his skin unnaturally pale from head to
      foot. </p><p>He was very obviously not alive. </p><p>I''d never seen a dead
      body before, not ever. But I was sure that no living person could lie that perfectly
      still. </p><p>This definitely wasn''t what Ian had expected when he''d invited
      us in. He rushed to the body and knelt beside it. In what seemed like one motion,
      he opened his medical bag and snapped on a blue latex glove. He pinched one
      of the body''s wrists, gently, checking for a pulse I guess, but he must not
      have got what he needed because he put on the other glove, grabbed one of the
      shoulders, and turned the whole body over.</p><p>It jostled onto its back and
      lay face up. </p><p>I didn''t think I recognized whoever it was, but the face
      was so sunken and gray I wasn''t sure. To me, it looked like someone that had
      been dead for a long time, weeks maybe. But I guess I don''t know anything about
      how bodies decay&mdash;the cheerleaders must have used the locker room only
      a couple of hours earlier, and the body couldn''t have been in the shower then.
      </p><p>Ian touched the body''s throat, again checking for a pulse which I knew
      wouldn''t be there. </p><p>I''d been so distracted by the deteriorated face,
      it was only now that I noticed what Ian was staring at. He and everyone else.
      </p><p>Mrs. Whipple was letting out this long-winded weeping sound and starting
      to cry. </p><p>Ian glanced at me, obviously regretting that he''d let me and
      Shawn come inside, but now there wasn''t anything he could do about it. He returned
      his attention to the body, maybe not entirely sure what to do next.</p><p>It
      was missing its penis. Where the penis should have been was just this short
      fleshy stump. The wound was raggedly scabbed over and looked infected. </p><p>I
      was so stunned that I didn''t even feel sick, not even when I saw what was below
      the missing penis: two baseball-sized spheres of tightly swollen flesh. They
      were the testicles, puffed up unnaturally and darkened to a deep, blackish purple,
      like a pair of giant toxic mushrooms. </p><p>I could hear Shawn breathing heavily
      behind me. I worried he was about to pass out and I wouldn''t know what to do.</p><p>"Holy
      fuck," he whispered. </p><p>In the middle of all of this, Ian''s phone rang.
      He fumbled to answer it. </p><p>He listened. "Yeah, it''s here," he said. I
      could tell it was the hospital dispatcher again. "<i>Now</i> you tell me," Ian
      said, exasperated, then he paused. "Right now?" Another pause. "That''s not
      how we do things. I don''t care who&mdash;" He stopped and listened again. After
      a minute, reluctantly he said, "Well, I guess. I guess if that''s what they
      say. I don''t know. I''ll do what I can. Jesus."</p><p>Ian stood and turned
      away from us. For a moment he just held his wrist to his head, apparently trying
      to figure out what to do. Outside, in the distance, the football game''s final
      buzzer sounded over the loudspeakers.</p><p>"Shit." </p><p>Finally Ian turned
      toward us. </p><p>"We have to get this out of here right now." He gave my husband
      a hard look. "Shawn, buddy. I hate to ask you to do this. But I need a hand.
      I can''t get it into my rig on my own. I got pretty strict orders to clear this
      out before the crowd comes through after the game." He nodded in the general
      direction of the football field. "And everyone''s on their way now."</p><p>Shawn
      was silent. He took one step backwards, then he threw up all over a changing
      bench. </p><p>Instinctively I put a hand on my husband''s back while he retched.
      I didn''t know what else to do. I glanced at Ian. He looked completely at a
      loss.</p><p>"I''ll help," I said. "I''ll do it."</p><p>I stepped toward the
      body before I could lose my nerve. Ian looked extremely uncomfortable, but I
      could tell he knew he didn''t have any other choice but to accept my help. </p><p>"Shit,
      Ashley," he began, "you don''t..." </p><p>"I can do it." I said. </p><p>I pulled
      two gloves from the cardboard box in Ian''s medical bag and put them on.</p><p>"Shit,"
      he said, again.</p><p>"Just tell me what to do. What do I do?"</p><p>Ian took
      a deep breath. "Alright. Shit. You take the ankles. It''s not far. Let''s just
      hurry and get this over with. God damn it, Ash. I owe you."</p><p>I tried not
      to think about what I was doing. I tried to tell myself that this was no different
      than a dead animal, or a dummy. </p><p>But as I clutched the body''s ankles,
      the tendons and bones beneath the skin felt so human and lifelike that I started
      to feel dizzy. I tried to breathe, but I hadn''t expected the smell to be so
      strong. It was definitely the smell of rotten flesh. I wondered if maybe the
      rancid smell was coming from the swollen testicles; they did look like they
      were rotting or maybe turning gangrenous.</p><p>I had to do something to distract
      myself so I wouldn''t throw up. I was desperate not to let Ian down. I knew
      that my sister wouldn''t be able to do this, and somewhere deep inside I''d
      always understood that Danielle couldn''t ever really let herself imagine what
      Ian must have gone through in the war. I wondered if by helping him now, in
      this unlikely way, maybe I could somehow acknowledge what my sister couldn''t.</p><p>"What
      do you think happened to him?" I asked Ian. </p><p>I didn''t actually care what
      had happened, not at that moment. But I couldn''t think of any other way to
      get my mind off the smell and the body''s sagging, loose weight in my hands
      as we shuffled through the locker room.</p><p>"I have no idea," Ian whispered.
      "He must have been trying to peep through the window. And then I guess he fell
      through the glass."</p><p>"But what about...?" I started. "Why is it missing?"
      </p><p>If I could barely bring myself to ask about the missing penis, I couldn''t
      even begin to mention the bloated testicles. They appeared at the point of bursting
      as the body swayed between us.</p><p>Ian gave me a look of total perplexity
      and shook his head. "I have <i>no</i> fucking idea."</p><p>"It''s one of those
      carnies!" Mrs. Whipple was still crying, but she was in control enough to make
      this last proclamation as she held the locker room door open for us, shuddering.
      "They''re all on drugs!" </p><p>The hardest part was lifting the body into the
      back of Ian''s SUV. </p><p>Ian laid the shoulders on the tailgate while I kept
      ahold of the ankles. I''d managed to control my nausea, but now my arms were
      burning. I didn''t even want to think about letting the body drop, or the sound
      of it hitting the pavement. Ian climbed into the back and pulled the shoulders
      from the inside, and finally I could let go. I looked around the dark lot outside
      the gym. I didn''t think anyone saw us, but I could hear the crowd from the
      game moving in our direction.</p><p>"You okay?" Ian asked.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>"I''m
      real sorry, Ash," he whispered. "Really."</p><p>"It''s okay." I tried to smile.
      "I fucking need a drink," I laughed, "but I''m okay."</p><p>Now Ian laughed
      too, obviously relieved that I''d been able to handle it. Maybe he was even
      a little impressed. </p><p>After laughing, though, he added earnestly, "Technically
      you weren''t supposed to see any of this. Right?"</p><p>"Right," I nodded. "Of
      course. Okay."</p><br><p><span class="new_section_first_letter">I</span> helped
      Shawn wash the splattered vomit off his shoes while Mrs. Whipple hurried to
      sweep up the broken glass. </p><p>I bought Shawn a Sprite from the vending machine,
      which he said helped his stomach, but I had to hurry him out of the locker room
      before the cheerleaders arrived. </p><p>By now everyone who had been watching
      the football game was passing through the parking lot on their way to the fair.
      No one seemed to have a clue about what had just happened. My sister was there
      with Haley, waiting for Tyler to finish showering. </p><p>"They won! Tyler scored!"
      Danielle waved to us. She had no idea what had just happened. "What are you
      guys doing here? I thought Ian was taking you straight to the beer garden."</p><p>"He
      got called to the hospital on the way, so he dropped us here." </p><p>Technically
      I wasn''t lying. I wasn''t sure what Ian did or didn''t want me to say, even
      to my sister.</p><p>Haley skipped over to me, obviously totally hopped up on
      excitement for the fair. I remembered feeling the same way when I was a kid.</p><p>"Aunt
      Ashley!" She slammed into me and gave me a hug. I hugged her back tentatively.
      I''d washed my hands and arms three times in the locker room, but I was still
      hesitant to touch my niece after what I''d just done. "Are you going with me
      to the carnival tonight?" she pleaded.</p><p>"Tomorrow!" I said. </p><p>It was
      so hard to say no to Haley. Over the last couple of years my niece had turned
      into this blonde-haired, wide-eyed kid, kind of small for her age, just like
      I''d been at nine. I got to play the role of the fun, slightly reckless aunt
      when I was with her. Last year at the fair we''d spent hours playing the same
      pin-ball horse racing carnival game I used to be addicted to as a kid, and I''d
      taught her how to cheat by tipping the machine. </p><p>But there was no way
      I was going to do anything tonight other than have a drink as soon as possible&mdash;an
      even stiffer one than I''d planned on earlier.</p><p>"But I want to play the
      horses!" Ashley whined.</p><p>Danielle cut in, saving me. "Aunt Ashley and Uncle
      Shawn are having an adults'' night tonight," she announced. "Grandma and Grandpa
      will take you to the horses."</p><p>Haley looked up at me, pouting, which was
      annoying but still I felt guilty for letting her down.</p><p>"Tomorrow we''ll
      play the horses," I promised. "Just you and me."</p><p>"You guys want a ride
      over?" Danielle asked. "Tyler''s still gonna be a while."</p><p>"I feel like
      a walk," I said. "Maybe I''ll see you over there."</p><p>It felt weird just
      traipsing off to the fair after everything that had happened. Someone had just
      died, and I''d just helped carry his body in my hands. It all felt completely
      unreal. I guess the right thing to do would have been to just go home, have
      a sober, contemplative evening, and try to make sense of what had happened.
      But I couldn''t imagine anything worse than being stuck alone with Shawn way
      out there in our quiet little house. I needed to be around people, a lot of
      them. I needed to get rid of the image of the mutilated body. I could still
      feel its weight in my arms. I was also really hoping to catch up with Ian later
      and find out if he''d learned anything about who the guy was, or what had happened
      to him before falling into the locker room, or why we''d had to rush the body
      away so fast.</p><p>Shawn and I joined the crowd making its way to the fairgrounds.
      I kept expecting him to object to continuing on to the fair, but he just walked
      along beside me silently, still pretty pale in the face. </p><p>"How are you?"
      I asked, folding my arms against the September evening air.</p><p>"Fine," he
      said. "I''m fine."</p><p>He didn''t really look at me. </p><p>I knew he was
      embarrassed that I''d had to be the one to help Ian. This is why he wasn''t
      saying anything. He would have been too ashamed to insist on running home now
      if I wasn''t suggesting it first. Or maybe he also just really wanted a drink.</p><br><p><span
      class="new_section_first_letter">W</span>hen we reached the beer garden, Morgan
      wasn''t even there yet. She was always late. I should have known. </p><p>I texted
      her, and she replied right back. </p><p>"<i>b ther soon wait 4 me.</i>"</p><p>So
      there was nothing to do now but wait around with Shawn''s friends, who of course
      had been at the beer garden for at least an hour by then.</p><p>Jason Gibbs
      was already mostly drunk. Right away he bought me and Shawn a beer. </p><p>Jason
      was a few years younger than us. I even used to babysit him. In high school,
      he was the basketball star, but of course no one from Muldoon ever gets a scholarship
      anywhere so he''d worked at the mill for a while with Shawn. Now he was a highway
      patrol cop; I had no idea how he''d gotten the night off. He was always a little
      shit as a kid. He used to try to take Polaroids of me peeing from outside their
      bathroom window. For a while, though, I''d hoped that maybe he''d influence
      Shawn to go to the patrol academy too, and I guess I still did, so mostly I
      tolerated him as one of my husband''s friends.</p><p>Shawn drank his beer down
      as fast as I''d ever seen him drink. I bought the next round, getting a vodka
      tonic for myself this time.</p><p>"Whoa, Ashley!" Jason pressed his plastic
      beer cup into my drink. "Somebody''s partying tonight!"</p><p>"It''s been a
      long day," I confessed.</p><p>Jason tapped Shawn''s arm. "You better watch your
      wife, bro. It''s fair time. She keeps going like that, might end up with somebody
      else''s dick in her ass. Not saying whose, I''m just saying."</p><p>Shawn finished
      the last of his second beer. "You might end up with somebody''s dick down your
      throat, dude," he said. Some of his color had come back. "And I''m saying whose.
      Mine."</p><p>"Charming, as ever," I said to both of them. But I didn''t mind
      that Shawn had actually sort of stuck up for me, even if it was by threatening
      his friend with forced fellatio in the middle of ordering more beer.</p><p>I
      tried to express as much of my annoyance with Jason as possible, but I was distracted
      by the way his long, horsey face was capped by whatever spiked thing he was
      trying to do with his hair. A couple of strands actually kept bobbing up a down
      whenever he laughed, which I don''t think he was aware of.</p><p>"I don''t know,
      bro," Jason said, now without taking his eyes off me. "We have a history, me
      and Ashley. She told you didn''t she? She used to beg my parents to go out of
      town. I had the biggest cock of all the kids she babysat for. When they got
      home, she used to be, like, ‘No Mr. And Mrs. Gibbs, you don''t owe me anything.
      Little Jason took care of all my needs.'' Your wife''s a nympho, bro! Seriously!"</p><p>Apparently
      my husband thought the high-pitched voice Jason used to impersonate me was the
      funniest thing in the world. Shawn was laughing, and now Jason started laughing
      at his own joke, and this only made Shawn laugh harder. Apparently this was
      how much easier it was for Shawn to put the locker room out of his mind than
      it was for me.</p><p>"No, dude!" Shawn said. "You don''t even know! I mean,
      she kind of <i>is</i> a nympho!" My husband laughed hilariously at this revelation.</p><p>All
      I''d wanted was to have a drink and to try to calm down a little. And now I
      had to deal with this. </p><p>The worst part was that I didn''t even know what
      to say. I thought about bringing up how I knew Jason used to whack off to Tina
      Frame''s picture in the yearbook, but I didn''t have it in me. I was too mentally
      fried, and I didn''t care. I just sat there shaking my head like some prudish
      idiot.</p><p>"Ashleeeey!" Morgan''s arms suddenly wrapped around me from behind.
      She almost knocked me off my barstool.</p><p>I stood and hugged her back, spilling
      my drink. "Where the hell have you been?"</p><p>Morgan was already completely
      tanked. She gave me a big, whiskey-tainted kiss on the cheek. It was weird how
      happy I was to see her. For a moment I almost started to cry. </p><p>"<i>You</i>
      and <i>me</i>," Morgan said, shaking her hips with each word in a little drunken
      dance, "are going <i>to</i> ..."&mdash;she held up the back of her wrist, stamped
      with a green <i>T</i>&mdash;"the Bryce Tripp concert!"</p><p>Jason scoffed.
      "Bryce Drip''s a fucking faggot."</p><p>"And we''re leaving these two <i>losers"</i>&mdash;Morgan
      traced a circle in the air, then pointed at Jason''s and Shawn''s faces&mdash;"right
      here in the fucking <i>lame ass</i> beer garden." </p><p>Morgan displayed her
      stamped wrist again, then tilted her head coyly, held out her tongue, and, like
      an inebriated pole dancer, gave her stamped wrist a long, sexy lick. </p><p>Jason
      glanced at Shawn. </p><p>Now Morgan grabbed my wrist and pressed it against
      hers, transferring the green <i>T</i> concert stamp to my wrist, just like we
      used to do years ago to sneak one of us into the movie theater.</p><p>Before
      I could finish the last of my drink, Morgan was pulling me away by the hand.
      I didn''t even so much as wave to Shawn before leaving him there.</p><p>On the
      way through the carnival, Morgan hung on my shoulder and whispered, "I''ve been
      sleeping with Jason." She made a gagging sound. "Gross, huh! I know, I know!"</p><p>I
      was surprised. "Morgan!" She had this great body, but I''d always been the one
      with the more-or-less cute face. She was always trying to prove that she was
      attractive by sleeping with one guy or another. But I hadn''t expected she''d
      sleep with Jason. "Why him?"</p><p>"It''s okay, Ash," she said. "Because I''m
      already cheating on him!" Morgan snorted a laugh. "Don''t tell him! It''s way
      more fun cheating on him than it is sleeping with him!"</p><p>I couldn''t help
      but laugh with her. </p><p>"You''re fucking crazy," I said. I was actually feeling
      a little better. </p><p>As we passed the Tilt-A-Whirl I whispered, "So who are
      you cheating on him with, then?"</p><p>She held a finger to her lips. "Shhhhh.
      Not saying."</p><p>"Who? Tell me."</p><p>"Not saying!"</p><p>Morgan bounded
      ahead. I had no idea who her mystery man was, but I worried it might be someone
      married if she wouldn''t tell me. Knowing Morgan, though, I''d find out one
      way or another before too long. She never kept a secret.</p><p>She was already
      through the concert gates, waving at me to follow her in. </p><p>Suddenly I
      flashed on the body in the locker room, again. I''d actually managed to forget
      about it for a little while, but now the image of its mouth hanging open came
      back to me. I''d kept glimpsing its teeth while I''d helped Ian carry it. </p><p>For
      some reason this made me nervous about sneaking into the concert. We weren''t
      kids any more, and I''d be mortified if I got caught now, as an adult, especially
      tonight. I even knew the woman collecting tickets and checking stamps. Her husband
      was one of the truckers at the company I worked for. </p><p>Morgan gave me a
      shrug from the other side of the gate. Then she impatiently waved me in again.
      </p><p>"Hurry up!" she yelled.</p><p>I stepped forward, trying to keep as far
      from the counter as possible, holding up my wrist with its faint green <i>T</i>.
      I''d never been as good as Morgan was at playing things cool. </p><p>Of course
      the woman collecting tickets recognized me. </p><p>"Ashley! Hi! I thought you
      weren''t going to the concert?"</p><p>"Hey Helen," I smiled, scared; she already
      suspected me, I could tell. "Well, my friend bought me a ticket," I said awkwardly.
      "We came in earlier? I just went out for a sec to say hi to my niece."</p><p>I
      had no idea where these lies were coming from, or how believable they were.</p><p>"Well
      let''s see that stamp of yours."</p><p>My heart was pounding. This was so stupid.
      Someone had just died and I was about to get caught sneaking into a concert
      by some musician I''d never even heard of and whose bus had blocked my car in.
      </p><p>"I''m gonna be late!" I joked nervously.</p><p>Helen took my hand and
      examined the stamp. This was it. I glanced around. What would she do? Were there
      security guards she would call? I saw one guy, arms folded, standing at the
      entrance to the grandstands. I was pretty sure he was already looking over at
      me.</p><p>"That''s what I thought!" Helen declared, inspecting my stamp. "Ashley!"
      She frowned and clucked her tongue. "You''ve almost worn your stamp off already!
      I can barely see it. Here." She plunked her rubber stamp into the inkpad and
      gave me a fresh <i>T. </i>"Enjoy!"</p><p>As soon as I was through the gate,
      Morgan grabbed my arm and hurried me toward to the grandstands. </p><p>"You
      totally thought fucking Helen Sandburg was going to arrest you or something,
      didn''t you!" She laughed at me. "I saw the look on your face! You did! Always
      such a <i>good kid</i>." She squeezed my neck. "Ah, that''s why I love you."</p><p>I
      hated that Morgan thought about me that way. But it was true. I let that ass-hole
      Jason treat me like shit. I let Shawn belittle me after I''d just wiped vomit
      off his shoes. And now I was afraid that sweet wouldn''t-accuse-a-fly-of-buzzing
      Helen would turn me into the cops. It was a good thing Morgan loved me, however
      innocent she thought I was.</p><p>I was suddenly determined to get completely
      wasted.</p><p>The concert was packed. It was disorienting to see the rodeo grounds
      transformed into a country music venue and filled with so many people from out
      of town. I led Morgan all the way to the standing-only area in front of the
      stage. We must have missed all the opening acts because Bryce Tripp himself
      was already playing. He was sitting on a stool wearing boots and a sleeveless
      shirt, looking like an underwear model with a guitar and a cowboy hat. I thought
      maybe he was even wearing makeup. </p><p>He was singing some ballad that nobody
      seemed to know except for a small group of middle-aged women I didn''t recognize,
      each holding up a cigarette lighter and swaying idiotically. </p><p>Pretty much
      everybody else was at least as drunk as they were, but more restless. A couple
      of guys I recognized from Biggs, the next town over, started yelling at the
      stage.</p><p>"Hey dick lick! Pick it up, pretty boy! Fucking slow!"</p><p>Bryce
      Tripp seemed to get the hint. Next song he called out his backup band, slung
      on an electric guitar, and started playing a much faster song whose only lyrics
      I could catch were "beer" and "bullets." </p><p>Half the crowd was down in front
      of the stage dancing drunkenly. Morgan bought beers and managed to pour a shot''s-worth
      each of whiskey from her purse flask. "Boilermakers!" She yelled over the speakers.
      </p><p>I could tell already that the concert wasn''t going to end well. There
      was just this feeling in the air. Too many guys who basically wanted to drink,
      and drink more, and then break whatever rule they could find to break. Halfway
      into his set, Bryce Tripp slowed it down again, this time playing a crooning
      love song. A guy nearby took the opportunity to slow-dance with this girl I
      vaguely recognized from the beer garden. He had his hands all over her, then
      he started really grabbing her ass. I was pretty sure she''d been with somebody
      else at the beer garden. It was actually kind of weird how the guy wasn''t just
      grabbing her ass but totally reaching around and down between her legs, and
      she was just letting him go at it.</p><p>That''s when I got knocked over. </p><p>Some
      guy had trampled into me, fists swinging. As I fell, his elbow caught me behind
      the ear. I spilled what was left of my second boilermaker and scraped my palm.
      </p><p>"Ass hole!" Morgan screamed and tried to help me up.</p><p>This was just
      as the guy who''d knocked me down&mdash;it was the same guy I''d seen with the
      girl in the beer garden&mdash;punched the guy she was dancing with squarely
      in the face. But then yet another guy I''d never seen before pushed them both
      right back into us, and we got knocked over again. </p><p>An all-out brawl broke
      lose. </p><p>Morgan and I crawled to the edge of the stage, and Bryce Tripp
      finally stopped playing. A security guard took over the microphone while a handful
      of rent-a-cops tried to stop the melee. I checked my palm, which was only barely
      bleeding, and my head, which felt fine, but this may have had a lot to do with
      how drunk I was at that point.</p><p>When I looked up, Morgan was talking to
      Bryce Tripp. I couldn''t believe it.</p><p>"Why''d you stop playing?" she yelled
      out while the scuffle continued on, barely abated, behind her.</p><p>I was sure
      Bryce Tripp would just ignore her, but he actually smiled and said something.
      Neither of us could make it out over the bullhorn. </p><p>"What?" Morgan screamed.
      I hadn''t seen her this drunk in a long time.</p><p>Bryce Tripp smiled again
      and shook his head. I couldn''t believe it, but he actually approached us at
      the foot of the stage and kneeled down to talk to us.</p><p>"They won''t let
      me keep playing," he said. "It''s actually in my contract." </p><p>He had these
      crazy icy-blue eyes. I honestly don''t think I''d ever seen anyone better looking
      from this close, in person. </p><p>"You know," he added, and shrugged. "The
      ‘safety of the performer at risk'' and all that."</p><p>Morgan was in full flirting
      mode. "So you always do what <i>they</i> tell you to do?" </p><p>She has this
      weird ability to flirt without making a total ass of herself, no matter how
      drunk she is.</p><p>Bryce Tripp laughed. He was even cuter with a full grin.
      I actually felt this wave of attraction pass over me when he spoke. </p><p>"Yeah,"
      he nodded. "I usually do pretty much what they tell me."</p><p>Morgan put on
      a pout and pretended like she''d lost interest. "Well, that''s a shame."</p><p>"No,
      not really," Bryce Tripp shot back, still grinning. "I get paid all the same.
      This is my third brawl in two months. Just means I get the night off. Which
      is fine by me."</p><p>He stood, reached into his pocket, and pulled out a stack
      of what looked like business cards. </p><p>"Couple of backstage passes," he
      said, handing one to Morgan and one to me. "Looks like I''m free for the evening.
      Why don''t you come on over and say hello."</p><p>Then he just gave us this
      friendly wave and left.</p><p>As soon as he''d left the stage, Morgan clutched
      her pass and screamed.</p><p>"Oh my fucking God! How do we get back there?"</p><p>There
      was a little security gate beside the stage which seemed to be the only way
      in.</p><p>By then the brawl had shifted toward the grandstands and we were able
      to make our move. We had to avoid an inebriated trucker pinned to the ground
      by a couple of security cops, but we managed to race to the side of the stage
      without getting knocked over again. </p><p>I couldn''t stop laughing. I hadn''t
      forgotten the body, but I was so drunk by now, I actually didn''t care that
      someone had just died.</p><p>This little panicking security guard was the only
      person manning the backstage gate. He was so focused on the brawl, standing
      on his toes and yelling into his cell phone, that he just waved us in without
      even really looking at our passes. He was probably used to letting local girls
      with passes backstage.</p><p>The area behind the stage was strangely empty.
      There were these couches set up outside, and a cold-cut buffet, and coolers
      of what I assumed to be beer, but no one was around. Bryce Tripp''s trailer&mdash;the
      same one that had blocked my car&mdash;was now pulled up alongside this sitting
      area. </p><p>But Bryce Tripp himself was nowhere to be seen. I don''t know what
      I expected, but not this. </p><p>Morgan grabbed a beer from a cooler and sat
      on the couch. </p><p>Just then someone came out of the trailer. A guy. He was
      dressed in tapered jeans and a fitted shirt and looked ready for an L.A. nightclub.
      </p><p>He lowered his sunglasses, and it was only now that I realized fully
      that this was Bryce Tripp, the same guy who''d just been singing twangy country
      songs in a Stetson.</p><p>"How do you like my disguise?" he asked.</p><p>"I
      can''t say it''s an improvement," Morgan said.</p><p>He folded his glasses and
      stashed them in his vest pocket. </p><p>"So where we going?" he asked. "If I''m
      going to buy you drinks, you two have to lead the way. I''ve never been here
      before. Where are we, anyway? Muldoon? Is that what it''s called?"</p><p>"Muldoon,"
      I confirmed, stupidly.</p><p>Morgan laughed. "Which means there''s only one
      place to go! Come on."</p><br><p><span class="new_section_first_letter">T</span>he
      Buckshot Bar is the single establishment where you can buy beer on tap year-round
      in Muldoon. During fair time it never closes, and it''s basically standing-room-only,
      twenty-four hours a day, all weekend.</p><p>I don''t think anyone recognized
      Bryce Tripp when we came in. He turned the head of just about every girl he
      passed when we all made our way inside, and at least a dozen half-sozzled guys
      sized him up. But he looked so different out of his western clothes that no
      one realized he was the same guy on all the concert posters. Everyone figured
      he was just someone''s out-of-towner friend, some pretty boy from the city.</p><p>"Well,
      ladies," he said, wedging himself into a place at the bar between me and Morgan
      on one said and Tuck Schroep, my second-grade teacher''s husband, on the other.
      "What''ll it be?" </p><p>I was already barely able to keep my balance, but I
      let him order me a whiskey. </p><p>It was while I was doing the shot that I
      saw Shawn at the back of the bar. He was nodding drunkenly at one of his friends
      from the mill.</p><p>For just a moment I worried he''d see me shoulder-to-shoulder
      with this extremely attractive stranger, the only guy in the bar in skinny jeans,
      and get upset. </p><p>But in exactly the next moment, I <i>hoped</i> he''d see
      me. I thought again about his complete inability to help Ian with the body in
      the locker room, and the way he''d laughed at me with Jason. Fuck him. </p><p>"Nate!"
      I yelled at the bar tender, pounding my hand and drawing as much attention to
      myself as possible. "Three more Maker''s!"</p><p>I had no idea if this worked
      because I lost sight of Shawn while a surge of a dozen people spilled in from
      the cancelled concert. I''m sure the bar was well past its legal capacity. I
      could hardly breathe. </p><p>By the time our next round arrived, Tuck Schroep
      was talking at Bryce and Morgan from beneath his hairy white mustache. </p><p>"Clean
      off!" he was saying, making a chopping motion with his hand. "That''s right.
      I''m telling you. Somebody''d cut his thingy clean off!"</p><p>I realized he
      was talking about the body. </p><p>I knew the news of a mutilated corpse in
      the girls'' locker room was going to spread like prairie fire, but not this
      fast. Mrs. Whipple must have told anyone within earshot after the football game.
      </p><p>And now everyone was on edge. I could tell. People weren''t just drinking
      because it was fair time. People were nervous, afraid. Things like this didn''t
      ever happen in Muldoon. I''d never even seen Tuck Schroep drunk before, not
      ever, come to think of it.</p><p>"What''s he talking about!" Bryce laughed.
      He couldn''t seem to figure out if Tuck was crazy or not.</p><p>"I don''t know,"
      I lied. I was desperate to come up with a way to change the subject. Before
      I could think of how, though, Tuck broke in again.</p><p>"He was trying to rape
      one of the girls, I guess!" he declared. "One of the cheerleaders. I don''t
      know which one of them cut it off, but one of ‘em did. Well, good for them,
      I say."</p><p>Someone put a hand on my shoulder. At first I thought it was someone
      trying to pay Nate, but whoever it was kept his hand there and pulled a little,
      gently turning me around.</p><p>"How you holding up?"</p><p>It was Ian. </p><p>I
      practically knocked Morgan over hugging him. "You''re already here! I didn''t
      think I''d see you."</p><p>He looked at me a little warily. He''d changed clothes;
      he''d probably showered. He was wearing his Army hoodie. He glanced at Bryce,
      then back at me. </p><p>"How you holding up?" he asked again.</p><p>"Fine!"
      I yelled over the bar''s noise. "Fine! Totally fine. Drunk off my ass, but fine!"</p><p>Bryce
      Tripp held out his hand. "Hey I''m Bryce," he said, charmingly.</p><p>Ian shook
      his hand. He was polite, but wary. "Ian." </p><p>I was actually pretty drunk
      at that point, but I could see right away that Ian was the only person in the
      bar who recognized Bryce Tripp from the posters. </p><p>"Buy you a drink?" Bryce
      asked him.</p><p>"Nate!" Morgan yelled before Ian could respond. "Four more!"</p><p>Ian
      grinned at me for the first time since he''d said hello. </p><p>"I did say I
      might have just one."</p><p>Bryce raised his shot glass. "Well, then, to&mdash;where
      are we? Muldoon! Prettiest little place I''ve ever avoided getting my ass kicked.
      So far." </p><p>Morgan laughed, we all clinked Bryce''s glass with ours, and
      I drank down yet another whiskey&mdash;who knows how many by that point. </p><p>After
      that point, things start to get hazy.</p><p>I remember Morgan talking to Ian
      about bear hunting with her dad, and Ian just nodding and listening to her drunken
      blather because he was too nice to tell her just to shut the fuck up. I remember
      actually grabbing Bryce Tripp''s arm and peeling him away from Tuck Schroep&mdash;something
      I never would have done if I hadn''t been so totally wasted&mdash;and staggering
      with him in tow onto the insanely crowded dance floor. I think I remember Shawn
      watching us dancing, but I can''t say for certain.</p><p>Next, I remember&mdash;just
      barely&mdash;asking Bryce if he smoked, and then I remember him buying cigarettes
      from the vending machine. I think I remember having one more shot at the bar
      and going outside to smoke, and I''m pretty sure I remember that Morgan actually
      talked Ian into having another shot with us. There was another moment outside&mdash;this
      one very hazy&mdash;when Bryce bummed someone''s last match, and he laughed
      when I told him he''d have to monkeyfuck me, which meant, I explained, lighting
      my cigarette from his. But I can barely remember this at all, and I can''t really
      say if it was before or after that round of shots with Morgan and Ian.</p><p>And
      that''s it, really. </p><p>The rest is totally gone. Anything else that happened
      that night is completely blacked out from my memory. </p><p>The next thing I
      remember is waking up alone in the Starlight Motel, sore from having had sex,
      without a phone, or a car, and, now, with night coming on.</p><p>I had no choice
      but to walk the half-mile from the motel to the fairgrounds, where I hoped my
      car would still be parked.</p><p>All the way there I still felt weirdly great.
      </p><p>I kept expecting a massive hangover to hit me, but it never came. I didn''t
      even have to pee, and I wasn''t really thirsty at all. I honestly don''t think
      I''d ever felt more rejuvenated in my life.</p><p>It was only when I reached
      the highway that I realized something was wrong. </p><p>It had to be the Saturday
      evening of fair weekend, but there wasn''t a single car on the road. </p><p>The
      traffic should have been bumper to bumper, even worse than it had been last
      night. Any other time of year, an empty highway would have been perfectly normal.
      But not tonight.</p><p>I walked faster. My footsteps through the gravel at the
      road''s shoulder was the only sound I could hear. It occurred to me, hurrying
      along while the sun sank into the mountains way off in the west, that I hadn''t
      seen a single person since I''d woken up. Not one.</p><p>The lights at the rodeo
      arena were on. And most of the street lights too. </p><p>But as I approached
      the fairgrounds, all of the carnival rides were totally dark. The Ferris wheel''s
      motionless silhouette rose up over the feedlot''s corrugated tin roof. There
      was no blaring carnival music, no roar of souped-up engines at the Saturday-night
      destruction derby, no cheers from the grandstands. </p><p>I hopped the fence
      into the parking lot. </p><p>There were only a few cars left. I was so relieved
      when I spotted my little gray sedan, parked all alone in the dimming evening
      light, that I practically ran to it. </p><p>I''d lost my set of keys along with
      my phone, but thank God Shawn had insisted that I keep a spare hidden under
      the battery. I popped the hood and found the extra key right where it should
      have been. </p><p>But the car door wasn''t locked. Which was odd, because if
      there was ever I time I''d be sure to lock my car door, it was during fair,
      especially if I''d parked in the public lot. </p><p>I wanted to get out of there
      as soon as I could and go home, or maybe to my parents'', or to Ian and Danielle''s,
      and to figure out what the fuck was going on. </p><p>I tried not to think about
      the unlocked door for now and I jammed the key into the ignition. Just as I
      put the car into drive I noticed something on the passenger seat.</p><p>It was
      a hoodie. A man''s. I kept my foot on the brake and held up the fabric. </p><p>It
      was Ian''s black Army hoodie. The one I''d seen him wearing at the bar. </p><p>So
      Ian had been in my car last night. </p><p>I tried again to think as hard as
      I could about what had happened after we were all at the bar. But it was no
      use. I had no memory whatsoever of anything after that.</p><p>In the dimming
      light I almost didn''t even see that there was something else on the seat. But
      when I moved the hoodie aside, there it was. </p><p>A gun. Ian''s gun. I recognized
      it right away. </p><p>It wasn''t like Ian was one of those guys who packed everywhere
      he went, but he must have been carrying it last night in the bar. And he must
      have had a reason. </p><p>But why would he have left his gun in my car? With
      the door unlocked? </p><p>I didn''t make sense. </p><p>Something was wrong.
      Something was really wrong. I had to get to Ian right away. I had to talk to
      him and find out what the hell was going on. </p><p>I hit the gas and drove
      my little car as fast as I could to toward the fairground''s nearest exit.</p><p>The
      exit was in the back, near the stockyard. On the way there I saw that everything
      at the carnival was totally shut down. All the food stalls were closed, and
      as far as I could tell, even the animals had been taken out of their pens. My
      headlights flooded the road and all of the motionless rides, but I didn''t see
      a single soul.</p><p>When I reached the gate, it was blocked. </p><p>A pair
      of wooden police barriers spanned the entire road. What the fuck was going on?</p><p>I
      almost screamed when someone knocked hard on my window.</p><p>"Ma''am?" It was
      a male voice, but it was too dark now to see who it was. Another couple of pounding
      knocks. "Can''t leave here, Ma''am."</p><p>It was a cop. He was knocking with
      his flashlight. I don''t know if I was more relieved that it was a cop and not
      someone trying to kill me or that it was simply another human being, the very
      first I''d seen that day. </p><p>I rolled down the window.</p><p>My eyes adjusted
      to the glare of the flashlight, and now I could see that the cop was Jason.
      Fucking great.</p><p>"I''m not authorized to let you through here, Ma''am."</p><p>"<i>Ma''am</i>?
      Who''s <i>Ma''am</i>? What the fuck, Jason?"</p><p>"Ashley. Whatever. You can''t
      pass through here." He was obviously still hung over, but this wasn''t stopping
      him from acting like an ass-hole cop now that he was on duty. "Vehicles can''t
      come or go until the search is over. Why are you even here? Why aren''t you
      at home?"</p><p>"I''m trying to <i>go</i> home," I said. "Just let me out."
      </p><p>"Can''t. Can''t let anyone in or out. We still haven''t caught those
      guys yet."</p><p>"What guys?"</p><p>"Are you kidding me?" Jason leaned casually
      against my car and folded his arms. This enraged me even further. "The guys
      who attacked that girl. Where have you been?"</p><p>Immediately my thoughts
      leapt to Haley. "What girl?" </p><p>"I don''t know." Jason shrugged. "Some girl.
      Some kid. It was two guys who did it. We''re still looking for them. We''re
      combing the fairgrounds. It''ll take a little time. The whole place is locked
      down. Here and the high school both. How do you not know about all this? Everyone
      was supposed to be out by two-thirty last night. They were announcing it for
      hours." Now he grinned that stupid smug grin of his. "Where were <i>you</i>?"
      He laughed. "You were fucking hammered last night! Having a little too much
      fun?" With this he gave a few rabbit-like thrusts of his pelvis. </p><p>I was
      too worried about Haley to care. </p><p>"Who was the girl, Jason? Just tell
      me who the girl was."</p><p>"I told you I don''t know, Ashley. Maybe if you
      weren''t so shitfaced last night you could have found out for yourself."</p><p>In
      the briefest of moments I thought about the gun under Ian''s hoodie. But I wasn''t
      stupid. </p><p>I had to focus on getting home as soon as possible, then calling
      Danielle on the landline. All I cared about right now was making sure that Haley
      was okay. I tried to remind myself that there were probably hundreds of little
      girls at the fair last night. But if something had happened to Haley after she''d
      begged me to take her to the carnival, and I wasn''t there, I''d have to kill
      myself.</p><p>I had to stay calm. I had to. I couldn''t afford anything else.</p><p>"Look,"
      I said to Jason, trying to control my voice. "You know me. I''m obviously not
      a suspect. All you have to do is move that roadblock and let me through."</p><p>Jason
      didn''t stop leaning against my car. </p><p>He grinned. Again.</p><p>"What''s
      the rush?" he said. "I mean, I can''t let you out. I told you that. And, hell,
      I sure could use some company." Now he leaned in closer and lowered his voice.
      "Here I am, stuck out here all alone on a chilly evening. What''s the hurry?"
      He winked. "It''d be just like old times."</p><p>"Let me the fuck out." It was
      everything I could do not to scream. "Right now. Jason. Let me the fuck out.
      There''s no way this is even legal. Let me the fuck out right now."</p><p>Jason
      put his head through the open window and brought it close to mine. He sniffed.</p><p>"You
      been drinking? Ashley? Are you still drunk, maybe?" Now he put his finger under
      my chin and turned my face around toward his. He sniffed again. "I wonder if
      maybe you''re getting just a little belligerent. I wouldn''t want to have to
      detain you. But if I have to, I have to. It''d be for you own good."</p><p>I
      couldn''t even think. I hadn''t ever been so enraged in my life. I just acted
      without planning. Suddenly I found that I''d slammed my foot into the gas pedal.</p><p>My
      car heaved forward. Jason spun around, and the next thing I saw of him was just
      his hand flopping out through the window. I''m not sure, but I may have broken
      his arm. </p><p>I didn''t have much time to wonder about it, though, because
      my bumper hit the two wooden police barricades. I lurched forward with the impact,
      and I worried for a moment that I might not make it through. But I just kept
      my foot on the gas, and my little car surged, knocked the barriers aside, and
      sent them tumbling onto the road. </p><p>I looked into the rear-view mirror.
      </p><p>My taillights were just bright enough to illuminate Jason limping forward.
      He raised his gun with one hand. I ducked and kept speeding forward as fast
      as my car would go. But I was already too far away; he lowered his gun without
      firing, and I turned the corner onto the completely empty highway.</p><p>I drove
      faster and faster, trying to catch my breath, maxing out at a little over ninety
      miles an hour. The road was completely empty. The night was completely dark.
      </p><p>And then I felt it: someone''s hand on my shoulder. </p><p>For a moment
      I tried to reason that this was impossible, that maybe my seat belt had tightened
      when I''d crashed through the barricades. But I wasn''t wearing my seat belt.
      </p><p>Someone really was in the back of my car&mdash;had <i>been</i> <i>in</i>
      the back of my car this whole time&mdash;and now they were touching my shoulder.
      </p><p>I felt an index finger slowly rise up the skin on my neck. Very lightly,
      it touched my ear.</p><p>I was driving way too fast to take my eyes off the
      road. My car was shuddering from the speed. Without really thinking about it,
      I held on tight to the wheel and reached for Ian''s gun. I felt its metallic
      grip at the tips of my fingers.</p><p>But I didn''t grab it. </p><p>And this
      is what''s really weird. This is what I still can''t figure out. Because more
      than anything else I was truly afraid that Haley had been hurt, or worse. I
      was also consumed by worry that I may have cheated on Shawn last night. And
      now I was truly, utterly terrified at the fact that someone was in the back
      of my car, running their finger along the softest part of my neck. And yet,
      despite all of this, that weirdly euphoric sensation of invincibility that had
      overcome me after waking up still hadn''t gone away. If anything, it was suddenly
      becoming more intense.</p><p>Whoever was behind me drew their hand down over
      my shoulder, slowly across my ribs and abdomen, then plunged it, very softly,
      into my underwear.</p><p>I still had no idea who it was, or how I could be so
      weirdly aroused at a moment like this. I flashed on dancing with Bryce Tripp
      last night, and lighting my cigarette from his, and his icy blue eyes, and I
      wondered if only someone as confident as he was could do anything so audacious
      as this.</p><p>And then I remembered something else while still trying to slow
      my car down without wrecking it. It hadn''t been Morgan who''d talked Ian into
      having one more shot with us, like I''d thought earlier. It had been <i>me</i>.
      Morgan had been goading him, but it wasn''t until <i>I''d</i> spoken up that
      Ian finally glanced in my direction, and, for just a moment, gave me this accidental
      look that seemed to say <i>I''d do anything you ask me to do, anything at all</i>.
      Then he drank down his second shot. </p><p>I took my hand from the gun. </p><p>Instead,
      I clutched the fabric of Ian''s hoodie in the seat beside me.</p><p>Whoever
      it was in the back seat of my car right now, reaching even deeper into my underwear
      while I tried to keep the car on the road, it was probably more likely that
      it was anyone in the world other than Ian. </p><p>And yet no matter how well
      I knew it couldn''t possibly be him, for a moment I <i>hoped</i> somehow that
      it was.</p>'

    - <p><span class="first_letter">I</span> really wasn't the kind of person who
      would ever act like this&mdash;or even think like this.</p><p>First of all,
      I wouldn't ever seriously consider sleeping around on my husband, even if maybe
      our marriage had fallen into a pretty deep rut. And I'm definitely not the kind
      of person who would ever actually get, well, just a little bit, um, wet, at
      the touch of a stranger's hand on my shoulder. It was true that I liked sex,
      just like everybody else does. And for a while I really liked it, especially
      with Shawn when we were younger and things had been going well between us and
      we were like best friends. But I wouldn't ever let anyone put their hand deep
      into my underwear while I was careening down a highway in the dark, probably
      not even Shawn in high school. And what I absolutely wouldn't ever do while
      a stranger's fingertip was beginning to press slightly inside me would be to
      actually hope that it was my sister's husband who was doing it. </p><p>Or at
      least I thought I wasn't that kind of person. Not until now. And I wasn't sure
      how I felt about it. </p><p>A voice whispered behind me. </p><p>It wasn't what
      I expected. It wasn't Ian's voice, that's for sure. And it definitely wasn't
      any guy I knew.</p><p>"You're <i>wet</i>," it said.</p><p>Then there was laughter.
      Shocked laughter. It was Morgan.</p><p>"Oh my God!" she said, no longer whispering
      and now laughing out loud. She jerked her hand out of my pants. "You actually
      got a little wet I think!" </p><p>Finally I was able to slow the car to a reasonable
      speed and I quickly turned my head, just enough to glimpse the outline of Morgan's
      face.</p><p>"What the fuck are you doing?" I snapped my head back around to
      keep my eyes on the road, then glanced in the rear-view mirror. "Morgan! What
      are you doing in my car?"</p><p>I was still so startled that I could barely
      process the fact that the person who had just had their hand down my pants had
      been my best friend. And it really weirded me out. So maybe one time at a lame-ass
      football party in high school some of the guys had pressured us into kissing
      each other, and we'd gone along just to prove we weren't prudes. But otherwise
      Morgan had never done anything like this.</p><p>She couldn't stop laughing.
      "Who did you think I was!"</p><p>"You scared the shit of me!" I said, trying
      to sound more annoyed than flustered and pretending I hadn't been turned on.
      "Morgan? What the hell? I almost wrecked the car! Your hands are like ice! What
      the fuck are you doing in here?"<p>

    - Going Down Six Feet Under
    - <p><span class="first_letter">I</span> held my hand up in front of my face.
      I moved my fingers.</p><p>I couldn't see anything at all. Nothing. I couldn't
      detect the slightest hint of movement. The darkness surrounding me was perfectly
      complete.</p><p>I tried to keep my breathing under control. The faster I breathed,
      the more oxygen I used up, and the less time I would have to live. </p><p>That's
      what I'd heard about being buried alive, anyway. I didn't see why it wouldn't
      be true.</p><p>Not that it really mattered whether I'd have just a few minutes
      to live or an hour. One way or another, this was it. I tried hard to accept
      the fact that I was going to die soon, that my life was going to end, that I
      was already beginning to suffocate. But it just didn't seem like it could be
      real, no matter how hard it was getting to breathe the air. </p><p>I reached
      out and touched the rough wood only a few inches in front of me. I could feel
      its raw, grainy texture. The scent of freshly-cut pine was overwhelming.</p><p>This
      was real.</p><p>When I was a kid I used to think that the most horrifying way
      to die would be to be buried alive. Worse than drowning, worse than getting
      killed in a car accident, worse even than being burned to death. The pain of
      burning would be unimaginably excruciating, I knew. But the horror wouldn't
      quite compare to suffocating inside a narrow, hot box beneath six feet of heavy
      dirt. </p><p>I even used to promise myself that I'd never get close to a coffin
      as long as I lived. Inviting even the remote possibility of ending up trapped
      inside one seemed like a stupid risk to take. </p><p>And yet somehow here I
      was. I'd let it happen.</p><p>I felt around for my cell phone and clicked it
      on. The screen's dim light glared. </p><p>The battery was now almost completely
      dead. I'd lost count of how many times I'd tried checking my phone for a signal.
      Nothing had changed; there was no service this far underground, and there wasn't
      ever going to be. </p><p>I clicked off the screen. </p><p>Once again I was lost
      in darkness.</p><br><p>It all started two days earlier when Morgan fell into
      a coma.</p><p>I don't know if it was because her mind just shut down from the
      trauma of being attacked by Mr. Hershel, or if it was because of some other
      reason which I didn't fully understand. But right after I saw her curled up
      in Ian's lap in my car, his arms holding her tightly and their lips somehow
      pressed together, Morgan convulsed briefly, then collapsed.</p><p>Ian tried
      to wake her.</p><p>"Morgan?" He shook her, and when she didn't wake he lightly
      slapped her face. "Morgan? Sweetheart, you need to stay with me! Morgan!"</p><p>But
      she wouldn't wake up. </p><p>I threw the spare clothes I'd grabbed into the
      back and squeezed beside Morgan, who was now lying slumped and unmoving in the
      passenger seat. </p><p>Ian raced us back to my parents' house. All the way there
      I did my best to keep talking to Morgan and calling her name into her ear, like
      Ian told me to do. But every time I gave her another series of brisk slaps,
      my best friend's head only rolled back down against her shoulder. </p><p>In
      the middle of all this, Ian tried to explain what I'd just seen going on between
      them. "I don't know what happened," he said. "I don't understand. I was trying
      to comfort her and suddenly her hands were all over me. And then she was kissing
      me. After everything she just went through." He shook his head emphatically.
      "I don't know why she would do something like that."</p><p>Everything about
      Ian's tone should have told me that he was telling the truth that Morgan had
      just started pressing her body against his and kissing him, out of the blue.
      But now, honestly, I couldn't be totally sure. The Ian I knew was an extremely
      honest person, but that didn't mean he was incapable of lying to me. I wasn't
      naive. After Morgan had told me at the fair that she was cheating on Jason with
      someone she couldn't name, and after I'd found Ian's hoodie and gun in my car
      where Morgan had slept, and after I'd just watched the way she'd been kissing
      him, I couldn't shake the idea that Morgan and Ian had been secretly sleeping
      together before all of this had started.</p><p>For now, I tried not think about
      it. Somehow I'd find out the truth later, but not now. More than anything else
      I was terrified that Morgan might die. She still wasn't waking up.</p>

    - Milk and Honey
    - <p><span class="first_letter">M</span>y phone's battery charge ticked down from
      two percent to one percent.</p><p>I shifted my weight and changed the angle
      of my head on Bryce's knee. I managed to find a slightly less cramped position.  </p><p><i>We're
      just in bed</i>, I kept trying to tell myself. <i>We're just in bed, under the
      covers, in a dark room. Soon, I'll just fall to sleep</i>.</p><p>I was scrolling
      through photos of my family. Any second now my phone's screen would switch off,
      and I wanted to see everyone one last time.</p><p>I was looking at Tyler and
      Haley in the photo I took of them before Tyler's first football game. He was
      lifting Haley off her feet, and they were both smiling ecstatically. I flipped
      to the next image. There was Shawn and me right after our wedding. He was thinner
      and looking happier than I'd seen him in a long time. Flip. There was my mom,
      knitting on the sofa. Flip. And there was my dad. He was fishing. He was sitting
      in the old lawn chair he always took to the river, gazing at the camera with
      the gentle look that was unique to my Dad.</p><p>I felt my chin start to quiver.
      Tears started to well in my eyes. I couldn't help it. Of all the people I'd
      never see again, I thought I'd miss my dad more than anyone else. I tried to
      cry quietly so Bryce wouldn't hear me.</p><p>I wiped my eyes with my shirt collar.
      When I opened them a text had appeared on the phone's screen.</p><p>Could this
      be possible? I looked at the cell reception meter. One tiny bar had appeared,
      then it quickly vanished. For a moment my phone must have got just enough reception
      for an old text to come through.</p><p>It was from Shawn:</p><br><p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;font-family:arial;font-size:.9em;"><i>i
      know where u r</i></p><p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;font-family:arial;font-size:.9em;"><i>why
      out there?</i></p>   <p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;font-family:arial;font-size:.9em;"><i>r
      u with bryce t?</i></p><br><p>My eyes flashed over the text, then I read it
      over a second time. What did it mean? How could Shawn know where I was? Had
      he somehow traced my phone? Did he know I'd been buried alive? If so, what did
      he mean by "out there?" </p><p>My phone's screen went black. The battery was
      dead.</p>

    - Don't Catch the Plague
    - <p><span class="first_letter">M</span>y mom wouldn't stop knitting.</p><p>When
      I came in through the door, she said, "So you've decided to grace us with your
      presence."</p><p>She refused to look up from the scarf she was making for Haley.
      It had grown by an arm's length in the days I'd been gone.</p><p>All I'd wanted
      was come home to my parents' house, spend a semi-normal evening with my family,
      maybe have one of my mom's home-cooked meals, then actually sleep in a bed.
      I really needed some sanity after everything I'd been through. And considering
      that I was going to try to seduce and drug Jason Gibbs tomorrow, I was hoping
      to get some rest so I could prepare. </p><p>But apparently Shawn and the rest
      of Jason's squad had told my family that I was wanted for hiding infected refugees.
      They all thought that I'd been gone because I was keeping Morgan hidden from
      the Home Guard. I thought about telling them what had actually happened, but
      how could I? I didn't think anyone would really believe that I'd been buried
      alive and locked in a stripped-down U-Haul for the better part of a week.</p><p>"I
      don't see why you don't just tell them where Morgan is," my mom scolded. </p><p>I
      hadn't realized that she was in such deep denial about everything that was happening.
      </p><p>"They know what's best for her," she went on, fiercely knitting at the
      kitchen counter while she lectured me. "They're keeping us all safe. I don't
      know why you have to go and disrupt all of that. They're all such nice boys.
      And Shawn! You should be so proud of him! This has been so good for him. You
      need to be more grateful. We're all just so lucky that the good guys are on
      our side, watching out for us."</p><p>We'd missed dinner. Ian was having a beer
      with Bryce on the porch, and I'd told them that I'd make up some sandwiches.
      My dad was washing the dishes. As I opened the fridge, he dried his hands and
      put an arm around me.</p><p>"It's good to see you," he said, softly so my mom
      wouldn't hear him. "I was worried. I'm glad you're home."</p><p>At the dining
      table, Danielle was playing cards with Tyler and Haley. My sister hadn't said
      a word to me since I'd arrived at the house. When I went to grab the bread knife
      from the table, she scowled. She stood up, placing herself between me and her
      children, then she whispered fiercely into my ear.</p><p>"I know you know where
      that little bitch is," she hissed. "She's probably the one who brought that
      disease in from outside. You need to tell Ian where she is. No more fucking
      around."</p><p>I hadn't realized how much Ian wasn't telling Danielle. She didn't
      have a clue about what was going on. He obviously didn't trust her to keep the
      granary a secret. And judging by how my sister was acting now, he was absolutely
      right not to trust her. She wasn't ever the most easy-going of the two of us,
      but I'd never seen her behave this way. The stress was really getting to her,
      I could tell. Suddenly, it seemed, she hated me.</p><p>"Play with us, Aunt Ashley!"
      Haley peeked around her mother and looked at me expectantly.</p><p>Even after
      all I'd been through, I felt really bad having to say no to my niece yet again.
      </p><p>"Next time," I told her, mussing her hair. "I've got some important things
      to take care of. And we have a guest," I said, nodding in the direction of the
      porch.</p><p>Tyler couldn't have heard what his mother whispered into my ear,
      but he looked at both of us apprehensively. He was still in that awkward stage;
      he was probably going to be good looking when he got out of adolescence, but
      his nose had suddenly gotten to big for his face, and his forehead was ringed
      with acne from wearing his football helmet. Poor kid. He just wanted life to
      be normal, to play football, and to meet girls his age. He'd been helping Haley
      fan out the cards in her hand, and I could tell right away that he was terrified
      at everything that was happening, even though he was putting on a good face
      and trying to help his little sister through it. I think he just wanted everyone
      to stick together and make it out alive.</p><p>"Let's just leave Aunt Ashley
      alone for a little while," he said, avoiding Danielle's gaze. "She's probably
      starving."</p><p>It was true. I was famished. Other than the military rations
      that the Home Guard had delivered to the house, my parents seemed only to have
      an endless supply of roast beef and white bread. While I made a sandwich each
      for Ian, Bryce, and myself, I ate at least another sandwich's worth of the meat
      with my fingers. I still had a strange, insatiable craving for a hamburger and
      a milkshake, but instead I poured a big glass of milk and gulped it down. I
      hadn't craved milk like this since I was a kid, but I couldn't get enough of
      it. I poured a second glass.</p>

    - Whetted Appetites
    - <p><span class="first_letter">F</span>rom my hiding place beside the highway,
      I heard someone approaching along the road.</p><p>The footsteps were slow and
      even, coming from way off in the distance. I sat up and stretched my back, making
      sure to keep low enough so that I would still be concealed behind the gully's
      rocks and brush. </p><p>It was dawn. </p><p>I was still cold, but not as miserably
      cold as I'd been all night. The sun was about to rise over the plains. I could
      see now that the leaves of the cottonwoods I'd been sleeping under were beginning
      to turn from green to yellow. But as I peered through the branches and searched
      the highway, I still couldn't see who was coming. The person was still on the
      far side of the bend in the road and concealed by the hillside.</p><p>But they
      were definitely getting closer. Now I could hear what sounded like something
      being dragged. With every other footstep came the sound of a chain clinking
      across the road's dry asphalt.</p><p>Finally a tiny figure emerged from around
      the bend. I looked around at my hiding spot in the gully, making sure that I
      was still concealed from the highway now that it was daylight. I was sitting
      within steps of the road, but I was pretty sure whoever was coming wouldn't
      be able to see me behind the cover of sage and low cottonwood branches. </p><p>It
      was a girl. </p><p>This came as a surprise, because the dragging chain sounded
      heavy. But the girl was walking with a slow, even pace. She didn't appear to
      be struggling at all. She just took one step accompanied by the dragging sound,
      then another quiet step, followed again by another step with the dragging sound.</p><p>As
      she drew closer, I could tell that she was only about eleven or twelve years
      old. </p><p>I didn't recognize her. She must have been someone from out of town.
      She had long brown hair, pulled back behind her ears, and she was wearing a
      dress. The dress looked like something she could have worn to a wedding, or
      maybe to church, except that it was filthy. What had once been white fabric
      had now soiled to a dull gray, closely matching the color of her equally filthy
      skin.</p><p>This uniform filth was probably why I didn't notice immediately
      that her dress was torn. The entire front section had been ripped away, revealing
      everything bellow her belly button. And she wasn't wearing any underwear. </p><p>My
      heart started to race. </p><p>As the girl came closer, I could see that her
      eyes were a beautiful green, but they were deeply sunken. And she was incredibly
      thin. Her hip bones jutted sharply from her waist. And yet her expression was
      perfectly calm. She was just staring straight ahead, keeping an even pace as
      she made her way down the empty road. She behaved as if she was perfectly clean
      and healthy, as if her dress was perfectly in tact, and as if her bare genitalia
      wasn't exposed for all the world to see.</p><p>And also as if nothing was attached
      to her foot. </p><p>I could see now that a steel animal trap was clamped around
      her ankle. Her foot was badly broken and twisted unnaturally. The trap's serrated
      jaws had dug through her skin, revealing her bone. Her toes were blackened and
      heavily swollen. Six feet of chain trailed behind her heel, and yet she was
      barely limping at all. </p><p>"Hey!" I shouted. I stepped out from the behind
      the brush. "Are you okay? You need help!"</p><p>The girl didn't respond. I clambered
      down the gully and onto the road. </p><p>"Stop!" I was close enough to her now
      to hear her steady breathing. "You need help. Sweetie, where are you parents?
      Stop!"</p><p>She didn't slow her pace. I actually had to step out of the way
      so she wouldn't bump into me. She just kept her gaze pointed at the far end
      of the road where it turned around the next bend. </p><p>I could smell her.
      Her foot was gangrenous. She smelled rotten. </p><p>She kept walking, and I
      didn't follow after her. She just kept marching casually onward, mostly naked,
      dragging the trap with her broken foot. The sound of the chain's jangling grew
      fainter as she moved on.</p><p>What else could I do?

    - <p><span class="first_letter">I</span> woke up to the sound of clucking chickens.</p><p>It
      was morning. My head was still so foggy from the sedatives I could hardly lift
      it to get a good look around.</p><p>I was in the chicken stall at the fair grounds.
      The rows of cages were still filled with birds that had been entered into the
      now-abandoned fair. They were starving, and molting. Some were dead. I was covered
      in loose hay and feathers. </p><p>Somehow, I was still holding on to half of
      Morgan's flannel shirt and Jason's wallet. I forced myself to sit up.</p><p>I
      had no memory of making it as far as the fairgrounds before passing out. I was
      still naked. My bare feet were cut and covered in dried blood. </p><p>I opened
      Jason's wallet. I threw out a debit card and some kind of Home Guard mess hall
      card. And then there it was. A simple white card with a magnetic strip, the
      words "Pharmaceutical Access," and a warning that finding it and not returning
      it to the Home Guard was a crime punishable by indefinite detention.</p><p>I
      kept the card and tossed Jason's wallet into one of the chicken cages. </p><p>I
      felt inside the breast pocket of what was left of Morgan's flannel. The single
      quarter I'd saved was still inside.</p><p>I crept from the chicken stall out
      into the sun. The morning was surprisingly warm after a cold night. The fair
      grounds were totally abandoned, and for a moment I just let the sunlight fall
      onto my naked body. I was still feeling pretty woozy, but I could feel some
      of my energy start to return. </p><p>I looked out toward the fields stretching
      away from the chicken stall. As far as I could see, Jason's SUV was gone. </p><p>The
      fair grounds, luckily, were filled with pay phones. The nearest was just across
      the roadway beside the horse stables. </p><p>I'd torn up Chris's letter after
      memorizing his number, but I was able to clear the cobwebs from my head just
      enough to remember the digits as I deposited the quarter. </p><p>Chris picked
      up right away.</p><p>"Please tell me this is Ashley," he said. He must not have
      recognized the incoming number and hoped it was a pay phone. "Is this Ashley?"</p><p>"I
      got it," I said. I told him where I was and asked him to pick me up. "Bring
      me some clothes, will you?" I added. "Don't ask. It's a long story."</p><p>While
      I waited for Chris, I found a relatively concealed place in the sun behind a
      wooden barrel that had been converted into a flower pot. I listened to the horses
      in their stalls, whinnying loudly. Poor things. They probably hadn't a heard
      a human voice for days, and they were probably starving. </p><p>I car approached.
      </p><p>I ducked down behind the flower pot and peered over its arrangement of
      dead pansies. </p><p>A hearse, covered in dust, pulled up in front of the stables.
      It came to a stop by the pay phone. Its engine cut.</p><p>Chris stepped out.
      He was in a white Home Guard uniform and a lab coat with two armbands, one with
      a black HG logo and the other with a red cross.</p><p>"Don't ask about the car
      and I won't ask about the clothes," he said, tossing a small duffel bag behind
      the flower pot. It landed by my bloodied foot. I unzipped it.</p>

      <p>The blog you are about to read was hosted by a teen under the name “Bailey Simms” for more than a year. Little is still known about the author’s actual identity.</p>

      <p>Among Ms. Simms’s blog posts is a completed serialized novel which has now been published as <i>Dead in Bed</i>. Interspersed within the novel’s segments, blog updates describe events in the author’s life from the winter of 2013 until the spring of 2015. At that point, the posts abruptly stop.</p>

      <p>None of this blog’s original material has been altered. The contents are disturbing.</p>

      . . .</p><p>So, hi everyone! Or, I guess I should say: hi absolutely no one!
      Because I’m sure exactly <i>zero</i> people are actually going to read this
      blog, and I’m pretty much just going to be shouting into the deep dark abyss
      of the internet. But whatever. I don’t care. If I don’t force myself to start
      a blog and post segments of my novel to it every week or so, I know I’ll never
      actually write it. And I really want to write this novel. Doing it means a lot
      to me. That’s why I’ve decided to publicly commit to it in this post.</p><p>In
      case someone actually <i>does</i> end up following this, thank you SO MUCH for
      reading! Seriously. You’re awesome and I love you! Please ignore the fact that
      I don’t even know you. You’re reading my blog, so I love you anyway despite
      that major flaw in our relationship. If you have any questions, just comment!
      Best way to reach me. I’ll totally respond. </p><p>Anyway, the very first installment
      of my novel is coming in the next update! It’s going to be called <i>Dead in
      Bed</i>. So stay tuned.</p><p style="text-align:right">xxBailey</p></div>'

    - "<div class=\"novel_text\"><p><span class=\"first_letter\">I</span> woke up
      in a motel room I’d never seen. No matter how hard I’ve thought about it since,
      I have no memory of how I got there or what happened the night before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      were beer bottles all over the side table. Not to mention a completely empty
      eighth of Jack Daniels. What looked like some kind of fancy foreign wine bottle,
      also drained, was filled with cigarette butts. The TV, one of those old boxy
      sets, had fallen back against the wall, and in the corner an armchair was lying
      on its side. Feathers were everywhere; one of the pillows had been torn open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was pretty sure I was alone. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one was in bed with me. When
      I leaned over to check the floor I saw only more feathers and more beer bottles
      scattered across the carpet—along with my clothes. All of them. My jeans were
      in a pile against the wall with my underwear still bunched inside. My bra hung
      over the one armchair that was still standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I realized, only
      now, that I was totally naked. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I’d definitely had sex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was sore, and not just a little. I hadn’t felt like this since Shawn and I were
      going at it like rabbits during my senior year of high school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      we hadn’t had sex in months, as far as could remember, anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried not to think about the fact that there was no good reason I would have
      needed to check into a motel if I’d been with my husband that night. I'm barely
      21, but I live in a really small town where just about everyone gets married
      before they're twenty, like I did. It's just what people do around here. I looked
      at the mess around me; I'd been with Shawn plenty long enough to know that he
      definitely didn’t drink wine. Not even whiskey, really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet
      despite my fear about whatever it was I’d done the night before, and despite
      my apparent blackout, and the pervasive smell of stale cigarettes—and some other
      smell too, I noticed now, something faintly rancid—I felt, well . . . <i>great</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was as if I’d been sleeping for days and had woken up completely refreshed.
      I didn’t have the slightest headache. I didn't feel a hint of nausea. When I
      stood up, I practically leapt out of bed. I pulled on my pants and felt like
      I had the energy to race up the face of a cliff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I still couldn’t
      remember anything. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than the bottles everywhere, there was
      no evidence of whoever else had been with me in the room. The only clothes I’d
      found on the floor had been mine, and the bathroom was empty. The only thing
      in the mini-bar fridge, weirdly, was an empty gallon milk container.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      looked under the bed and checked my pockets, but I couldn’t find my phone. So
      I couldn’t even look at my recent calls. Had I lost it, or had someone stolen
      it? I had no idea. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside, it was a beautiful day. But when
      I stepped into what I recognized now as the parking lot of the Starlight Motel,
      I realized that it wasn’t morning. The sun was already starting to set. Apparently
      I’d slept all afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that I was out in the fresh air,
      things started to come back to me about the day before, if not the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly
      I remembered what I'd found at the high school with my brother-in-law. I remembered
      how I’d helped <i>carry</i> it even. I remembered the stench, and how afterward
      I couldn’t quite wash off the smell. I wondered if maybe it was the scent I'd
      been smelling inside the motel room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also remembered why my
      car was nowhere to be seen. I live in Muldoon, Colorado, and if you haven’t
      heard of it, you’re basically like everybody else in the world who isn’t from
      Muldoon. We don’t even have a stoplight. It’s that small. The only thing that
      ever happens is the fair, once a year. The kids sell their livestock, there’s
      a carnival and a rodeo, and everyone pretty much has an excuse to get drunk
      all weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do the books at this trucking company whose office
      is right across from the fairgrounds. I usually park in the lot there, and when
      I got off work early yesterday there was this huge bus blocking my car. It was
      emblazoned with a massive <i>Bryce Tripp</i> logo. He was supposed to be this
      up-and-coming country star, but, honestly, I hadn’t heard of him before a few
      days ago. (How big could he really be if he was giving a concert at the Muldoon
      fair?) The people in charge of his bus must have been waiting to get into the
      rodeo grounds where his concert was going to be, but I couldn’t find the driver
      anywhere. I couldn’t even reach my husband because the cell phones were already
      jammed from everyone arriving from out of town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I’d asked my
      boss for a ride home. I remembered now. I’d figured I’d worry about my car later.
      I hadn’t really needed it anyway then because Ian, my brother in law, was supposed
      to give me and Shawn a ride to the fair that night so we could drink, then he
      was going to bring us home later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That had been the plan anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now
      I was at the Starlight Motel, alone, without a car or a phone, and still no
      memory at all of how I got there.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>
      tried to go back and piece together everything that had happened the previous
      day as best as I could. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I remembered that when my boss
      dropped me at home, Shawn was already there, watching TV, as usual. His station
      at the couch was pretty much the only place he spent time lately when he wasn’t
      at work. He has a shift at the mill, which I know can be exhausting, but it'd
      been months since he’d been out. And lately he’d started saying he didn’t want
      me to go out with any of my friends alone. One of the reasons I’d been looking
      forward to the fair for weeks was that Shawn wouldn’t have any choice but to
      get off his ass and go somewhere. I’d been hoping that maybe we could have a
      little fun again, for once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m getting in the shower,” I called
      out, competing with the blare of Sports Center. “Ian’s gonna be here in an hour,
      remember?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a moment, Shawn yelled back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Tonight?
      We’ll go tomorrow,\" he said. \"No one really shows up until Saturday anyway.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      should have seen this coming. If my husband never wanted to go out at all anymore,
      why would he ever go out for two nights in a row without complaining about it?
      I’d thought things would be different during fair, but I guess I’d been wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried not to sound too irritated. “Everyone always goes tonight.” I leaned into
      the living room and found myself talking to the back of my husband’s head. He
      was only twenty-six, but his hair was already beginning to thin. “All your friends
      are going. And mine. Morgan’s already there waiting for me. And Ian’s coming
      all the way back in the middle of Tyler’s football game just to give us a ride.
      It would be weird if you didn’t go.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Shawn could respond,
      I stepped into the bathroom and turned on the shower. I hoped that by putting
      myself out of earshot he would give up and agree to just go without a fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While
      I undressed, I forced myself to look at the mirror. I’d definitely put on a
      little weight since high school, but not as much as Shawn had, especially after
      his accident. But I looked okay, I decided. Nothing like Morgan, who’d somehow
      stayed as skinny as she was at sixteen. But at least I looked okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While
      the water warmed up, without really meaning to, I started considering what my
      night out would be like if Shawn <i>did </i>just stay at home. I thought about
      having the chance to ride into town with Ian alone. I thought about doing shots
      with Morgan, just the two of us. Maybe it wouldn’t have been the worst thing
      after all if Shawn didn’t come. In the middle of washing my hair, I actually
      started seriously considered persuading him to stay home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      by the time I got out of the shower I could hear him changing from his work
      clothes, and I decided not to say anything. I couldn’t. Not after I’d already
      talked him into going. I’d feel too guilty if I did something like that, anyway.
      Besides, it would probably be good for us to get drunk together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      pulled up to the house just as I was finishing with my makeup. I wore this new
      low-cut top I’d bought just for the fair and my tightest pair of jeans. Maybe
      it wasn’t exactly what they were wearing in Denver these days, but not bad for
      the Muldoon fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could tell my brother-in-law was in a hurry
      to get back before the end of the high school football game, but he was too
      polite to say so. As we came out of the house Ian kept his truck idling, sauntered
      over to Shawn, and slapped his shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hey, buddy, you all
      ready for tonight?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yup,” Shawn said. As always, Shawn was a
      little quiet and intimidated by Ian. “Ready to go.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hiya, sis!”
      Ian gave me a quick hug, then just as quickly he let me go and hopped back into
      his pickup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian was in a good mood. On the way over he told us
      that Tyler got a touchdown, and besides being happy that his son had played
      well, he was looking forward to being out at the fair tonight too. I could tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      sure you’re okay not drinking?” I asked him. “I’m glad I’m not the one stuck
      driving.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was glad Ian had offered to give us a ride, but the
      truth is I also liked how Ian got after a couple drinks. He’d been a medic in
      Iraq, and now he worked as an EMT at our tiny local hospital. When he got back
      from the war I used to worry he’d break down or something if he drank, but he
      never did. Mostly he just got less serious and his sense of humor would come
      out. I’d laugh at his wry jokes, and he always laughed along with me in this
      kind and warmly boyish way he had. He’s actually really attractive—way more
      attractive than Shawn—but sometimes I think my sister doesn’t even realize this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Who
      says I can’t have a beer?” Ian winked at me. “It’s fair time. I’ll nurse one
      for a little while.” He nudged Shawn’s arm. “Just don’t tell Danielle.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was pretty sure Ian really wouldn’t have any more than one drink. I don’t think
      I know anyone who’s more responsible. Besides, if he did, my sister would find
      out one way or another and kill him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was about to ask whether
      he was taking Haley, his youngest, to the carnival tonight, but that’s when
      Ian's phone rang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gruff, semi-garbled voice on the speakerphone
      must have been a hospital dispatcher, but I couldn’t make out who it was. “Ian,
      you there at the school?” the voice asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just left,” Ian said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      guess someone had a fall in the girl’s locker room, or something. Probably nothing,
      but could you check it out? Ambulance is still stuck here at the hospital.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      switched off the speaker and brought the phone to his ear. “Yeah, I’ll be there
      in a couple minutes.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He hung up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You don’t mind
      if we make a little detour, do you? It’s probably nothing, but I gotta check
      it out.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That’s alright,” I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in truth
      I was feeling selfish and a little disappointed that Ian couldn’t just drop
      us at the fairgrounds. What kind of town only had one ambulance? I guess Ian’s
      SUV was the sole backup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian pulled right up to the door of the
      girl’s locker room. The second half of the football game had already started.
      I could hear the hum of the crowd over at the field, but the gym was deserted.
      Shawn stepped from the pickup, but in an old high-school habit he was hesitant
      about going into the girls’ locker room, which I thought was kind of sadly funny,
      as if he were still just a kid. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian was in a hurry. “Come on
      in, if you want,” he told us. “We’re a little understaffed.” He laughed. “Maybe
      you could give me a hand, if I need it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hadn’t stepped into
      the locker room for years. Bernice Whipple, my old P.E. teacher, was even there.
      It was like she lived there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hey, Mrs. Whipple.” I gave her my
      best version of a friendly wave. But she didn’t even register my presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She
      was distraught, expressionless. She went right for Ian. She grabbed his jacket,
      then she led him toward the showers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Here,” she said, whispering.
      “Here. It’s here.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I followed behind, trying to stay out of the
      way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I first saw what was on the tile floor—the same place
      I’d stood showering a hundred times in high school—I thought maybe some kid
      was playing a joke, trying to scare the cheerleaders or something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      were shards of broken glass all over the shower, and, right above, one of the
      big frosted windows had been broken out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There wasn’t any blood.
      Just a person, naked, face down. It wasn’t a high-schooler at all, but a grown
      man, his bare ass in the air, his skin unnaturally pale from head to foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      was very obviously not alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d never seen a dead body before,
      not ever. But I was sure that no living person could lie that perfectly still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
      definitely wasn’t what Ian had expected when he’d invited us in. He rushed to
      the body and knelt beside it. In what seemed like one motion, he opened his
      medical bag and snapped on a blue latex glove. He pinched one of the body’s
      wrists, gently, checking for a pulse, I guess. But he must not have got what
      he needed because he put on the other glove, grabbed one of the shoulders, and
      turned the whole body over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It jostled onto its back and lay face
      up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t think I recognized whoever it was, but the face was
      so sunken and gray I wasn’t sure. To me, it looked like someone that had been
      dead for a long time, weeks maybe. But I guess I don’t know anything about how
      bodies decay—the cheerleaders must have used the locker room only a couple of
      hours earlier, and the body couldn’t have been in the shower then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      touched the body’s throat, again checking for a pulse which I knew wouldn’t
      be there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d been so distracted by the deteriorated face, it
      was only now that I noticed what Ian was staring at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He and everyone
      else. Mrs. Whipple was letting out this long-winded weeping sound and starting
      to cry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian glanced at me, obviously regretting that he’d let
      me and Shawn come here with him. But now there wasn’t anything he could do about
      it. He returned his attention to the body, maybe not entirely sure what to do
      next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was missing its penis. Where it should have been was
      just this short fleshy stump. The wound was raggedly scabbed over and looked
      infected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was so stunned that I didn’t even feel sick, not even
      when I saw what was below the missing penis: two baseball-sized spheres of tightly
      swollen flesh. They were the testicles, puffed up unnaturally and darkened to
      a deep, blackish purple, like a pair of giant toxic mushrooms. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      could hear Shawn breathing heavily behind me. I worried he was about to pass
      out and I wouldn’t know what to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Holy fuck,\" he whispered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      the middle of all of this, Ian’s phone rang. He fumbled to answer it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      listened. “Yeah, it’s here,” he said. I could tell it was the hospital dispatcher
      again. “<i>Now</i> you tell me,” Ian said, exasperated, then he paused. “Right
      now?” Another pause. “That’s not how we do things. I don’t care who—” He stopped
      and listened again. After a minute, reluctantly he said, “Well, I guess. I guess
      if that’s what they say. I don’t know. I’ll do what I can. Jesus.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      stood and turned away from us. For a moment he just held his wrist to his head,
      apparently trying to figure out what to do. Outside, in the distance, the football
      game’s final buzzer sounded over the loudspeakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shit.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally
      Ian turned toward us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We have to get this out of here right now.”
      He gave my husband a hard look. “Shawn, buddy. I hate to ask you to do this.
      But I need a hand. I can’t get it into my rig on my own. I got pretty strict
      orders to clear this out before the crowd comes through after the game.” He
      nodded in the general direction of the football field. “And everyone’s on their
      way now.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn was silent. He took one step backwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then
      he threw up all over a changing bench.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instinctively, I put a
      hand on my husband’s back while he retched. I didn’t know what else to do. I
      glanced at Ian. He looked completely at a loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ll help,” I
      said. “I’ll do it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stepped toward the body before I could lose
      my nerve. Ian looked extremely uncomfortable, but I could tell he knew he didn’t
      have any other choice but to accept my help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shit, Ashley,” he
      began, “you don’t…”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I can do it.” I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled
      two gloves from the cardboard box in Ian’s medical bag and put them on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shit,”
      he said, again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just tell me what to do. What do I do?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      took a deep breath. “Alright. Shit. You take the ankles. It’s not far. Let’s
      just hurry and get this over with. God damn it, Ash. I owe you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried not to think about what I was doing. I tried to tell myself that this
      was no different than a dead animal, or a dummy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as I clutched
      the body’s ankles, the tendons and bones beneath the skin felt so human and
      lifelike that I started to feel dizzy. I tried to breathe, but I hadn’t expected
      the smell to be so strong. It was definitely the smell of rotten flesh. I wondered
      if maybe the rancid smell was coming from the swollen testicles; they did look
      like they were rotting or maybe turning gangrenous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to do
      something to distract myself so I wouldn’t throw up. I was desperate not to
      let Ian down. I knew that my sister wouldn’t be able to do this, and somewhere
      deep inside I’d always understood that Danielle couldn’t ever really let herself
      imagine what Ian must have gone through in the war. I wondered if by helping
      him now, in this unlikely way, maybe I could somehow acknowledge what my sister
      couldn’t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What do you think happened to him?” I asked Ian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      didn’t actually care what had happened, not at that moment. But I couldn’t think
      of any other way to get my mind off the smell and the body’s sagging, loose
      weight in my hands as we shuffled through the locker room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      have no idea,” Ian whispered. “He must have been trying to peep through the
      window. And then I guess he fell through the glass.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“But what
      about his…?” I started, but I couldn’t finish. “Why is <i>it </i>missing?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If
      I could barely bring myself to ask about the missing penis, I couldn’t even
      begin to mention the bloated testicles. They appeared at the point of bursting
      as the body swayed between us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian gave me a look of total perplexity
      and shook his head. “I have <i>no</i> idea.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s one of those
      carnies!” Mrs. Whipple was still crying, but she was in control enough to make
      this last proclamation as she held the locker room door open for us, shuddering.
      “They’re all on drugs!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hardest part was lifting the body
      into the back of Ian’s SUV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian laid the shoulders on the tailgate
      while I kept ahold of the ankles. I’d managed to control my nausea, but now
      my arms were burning. I didn’t even want to think about letting the body drop,
      or the sound of it hitting the pavement. Ian climbed into the back and pulled
      the shoulders from the inside, and finally I could let go. I looked around the
      dark lot outside the gym. I didn’t think anyone saw us, but I could hear the
      crowd from the game moving in our direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You okay?” Ian asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      nodded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m real sorry, Ash,” he whispered. “Really.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s
      okay.” I tried to smile. “I need a drink,” I laughed, “but I’m okay.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now
      Ian laughed too, obviously relieved that I’d been able to handle it. Maybe he
      was even a little impressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After laughing, though, he added
      earnestly, “Technically you weren’t supposed to see any of this. Right?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Right,”
      I nodded. “Of course. Okay.”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>
      helped Shawn wash the splattered vomit off his shoes while Mrs. Whipple hurried
      to sweep up the broken glass. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I bought Shawn a Sprite from the
      vending machine, which he said helped his stomach, but I had to hurry him out
      of the locker room before the cheerleaders arrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By now everyone
      who had been watching the football game was passing through the parking lot
      on their way to the fair. No one seemed to have a clue about what had just happened.
      My sister was there with Haley, waiting for Tyler to finish showering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“They
      won! Tyler scored!” Danielle waved to us. She had no idea what had just happened.
      “What are you guys doing here? I thought Ian was taking you straight to the
      beer garden.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“He got called to the hospital on the way, so he
      dropped us here.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically I wasn’t lying. I wasn’t sure what
      Ian did or didn’t want me to say, even to my sister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haley skipped
      over to me, obviously totally hopped up on excitement for the fair. I remembered
      feeling the same way when I was a kid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Aunt Ashley!” She slammed
      into me and gave me a hug. I hugged her back tentatively. I’d washed my hands
      and arms three times in the locker room, but I was still hesitant to touch my
      niece after what I’d just done. “Are you going with me to the carnival tonight?”
      she pleaded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Tomorrow!” I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was so hard
      to say no to Haley. Over the last couple of years my niece had turned into this
      blonde-haired, wide-eyed kid, kind of small for her age, just like I’d been
      at nine. I got to play the role of the fun, slightly reckless aunt when I was
      with her. Last year at the fair we’d spent hours playing the same pin-ball horse
      racing carnival game I used to be addicted to as a kid, and I’d taught her how
      to cheat by tipping the machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there was no way I was going
      to do anything tonight other than have a drink as soon as possible—an even stiffer
      one than I’d planned on earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“But I want to play the horses!”
      Haley whined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Danielle cut in, saving me. “Aunt Ashley and Uncle
      Shawn are having an adults’ night tonight,” she announced. “Grandma and Grandpa
      will take you to the horses.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haley looked up at me, pouting,
      which was annoying but still I felt guilty for letting her down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Tomorrow
      we’ll play the horses,” I promised. “Just you and me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You guys
      want a ride over?” Danielle asked. “Tyler’s still gonna be a while.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      feel like a walk,” I said. “Maybe I’ll see you over there.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      felt weird just traipsing off to the fair after everything that had happened.
      Someone had just died, and I’d just helped carry his body in my hands. It all
      felt completely unreal. I guess the right thing to do would have been to just
      go home, have a sober, contemplative evening, and try to make sense of what
      had happened. But I couldn’t imagine anything worse than being stuck alone with
      Shawn way out there in our quiet little house. I needed to be around people,
      a lot of them. I needed to get rid of the image of the mutilated body. I could
      still feel its weight in my arms. I was also really hoping to catch up with
      Ian later and find out if he’d learned anything about who the guy was, or what
      had happened to him before falling into the locker room, or why we’d had to
      rush the body away so fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn and I joined the crowd making
      its way to the fairgrounds. I kept expecting him to object to continuing on
      to the fair, but he just walked along beside me silently, still pretty pale
      in the face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How are you?” I asked, folding my arms against the
      September evening air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fine,” he said. “I’m fine.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      didn’t really look at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew he was embarrassed that I’d had
      to be the one to help Ian. This is why he wasn’t saying anything. He would have
      been too ashamed to insist on running home now if I wasn’t going to suggest
      it first. Or maybe he also just really wanted a drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">W</span>hen we reached the beer garden, Morgan
      wasn’t even there yet. She was always late. I should have known. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      texted her, and she replied right back. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>b ther soon wait
      4 me.</i>”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there was nothing to do now but wait around with
      Shawn’s friends, who of course had been at the beer garden for at least an hour
      by then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason Gibbs was already mostly drunk. Right away he bought
      me and Shawn a beer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason was a few years younger than us. I
      even used to babysit him. In high school, he was the basketball star, but of
      course no one from Muldoon ever gets a scholarship anywhere so he’d worked at
      the mill for a while with Shawn. Now he was a highway patrol cop; I had no idea
      how he’d gotten the night off. He was always a little jerk as a kid. He used
      to try to take Polaroids of me peeing from outside their bathroom window. For
      a while, though, I’d hoped that maybe he’d influence Shawn to go to the patrol
      academy too, and I guess I still did, so mostly I tolerated him as one of my
      husband’s friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn drank his beer down as fast as I’d ever
      seen him drink. I bought the next round, getting a vodka tonic for myself this
      time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Whoa, Ashley!” Jason pressed his plastic beer cup into
      my drink. “Somebody’s partying tonight!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s been a long day,”
      I confessed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason tapped Shawn’s arm. “You better watch your
      wife, bro. It’s fair time. She keeps going like that, might end up with somebody
      else’s dick in her ass. Not saying whose, I’m just saying.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn
      finished the last of his second beer. “You might end up with somebody’s dick
      down your throat, dude,” he said. Some of his color had come back. “And I’m
      saying whose. Mine.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Charming, as ever,” I said to both of them.
      But I didn’t mind that Shawn had actually sort of stuck up for me, even if it
      was by threatening his friend with forced fellatio in the middle of ordering
      more beer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to express as much of my annoyance with Jason
      as possible, but I was distracted by the way his long, horsey face was capped
      by whatever spiked thing he was trying to do with his hair. A couple of strands
      actually kept bobbing up a down idiotically whenever he laughed, which I don’t
      think he was aware of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t know, bro,” Jason said, now without
      taking his eyes off me. “We have a history, me and Ashley. She told you didn’t
      she? She used to beg my parents to go out of town. She said I had the biggest
      cock of all the kids she babysat for. When they got home, she used to be, like,
      ‘No Mr. And Mrs. Gibbs, you don’t owe me anything. Little Jason took care of
      all my needs.’ Your wife’s a nympho, bro! Seriously!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently
      my husband thought the high-pitched voice Jason used to impersonate me was the
      funniest thing in the world. Shawn was laughing, and now Jason started laughing
      at his own joke, and this only made Shawn laugh harder. Apparently this was
      how much easier it was for Shawn to put the locker room out of his mind than
      it was for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No, dude!” Shawn said. “You don’t even know! I
      mean, she kind of <i>is</i> a nympho!” My husband laughed hilariously at this
      revelation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All I’d wanted was to have a drink and to try to calm
      down a little. And now I had to deal with this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The worst part
      was that I didn’t even know what to say. I thought about bringing up how I knew
      Jason used to whack off to Tina Frame’s picture in the yearbook, but I didn’t
      have it in me. I was too mentally fried, and I didn’t care. I just sat there
      shaking my head like some prudish idiot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashleeeey!” Morgan’s
      arms suddenly wrapped around me from behind. She almost knocked me off my barstool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      stood and hugged her back, spilling my drink. “Where the hell have you been?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      was already completely tanked. She gave me a big, whiskey-tainted kiss on the
      cheek. It was weird how happy I was to see her. For a moment I almost started
      to cry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>You</i> and <i>me</i>,” Morgan said, shaking her hips
      with each word in a little drunken dance, “are going <i>to</i> …”—she held up
      the back of her wrist, stamped with a green <i>T</i>—“the Bryce Tripp concert!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason
      scoffed. “Bryce Drip’s a fucking faggot.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And we’re leaving these
      two <i>losers”</i>—Morgan traced a circle in the air, then pointed at Jason’s
      and Shawn’s faces—“right here in the fucking <i>lame ass</i> beer garden.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      displayed her stamped wrist again, then tilted her head coyly, held out her
      tongue, and, like an inebriated pole dancer, gave her stamped wrist a long,
      sexy lick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason glanced at Shawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now Morgan grabbed
      my wrist and pressed it against hers, transferring the green <i>T</i> concert
      stamp to my wrist, just like we used to do years ago to sneak one of us into
      the movie theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I could finish the last of my drink,
      Morgan was pulling me away by the hand. I didn’t even so much as wave to Shawn
      before leaving him there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way through the carnival, Morgan
      hung on my shoulder and whispered, “I’ve been sleeping with Jason.” She made
      a gagging sound. “Gross, huh! I know, I know.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was surprised.
      “Morgan!” She had this great body, but I’d always been the one with the more-or-less
      cute face. She was always trying to prove that she was attractive by sleeping
      with one guy or another. But I hadn’t expected she’d sleep with Jason. “Why
      him?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s okay, Ash,” she said. “Because I’m already cheating
      on him!” Morgan snorted a laugh. “Don’t tell him! It’s way more fun cheating
      on him than it is sleeping with him!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t help but laugh
      with her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’re fucking crazy,” I said. I was actually feeling
      a little better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we passed the Tilt-A-Whirl, I whispered, “So
      who are you cheating on him with, then?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She held a finger to
      her lips. “Shhhhh. Not saying.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Who? Tell me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Not
      saying!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan bounded ahead. I had no idea who her mystery guy
      was, but I worried it might be someone married if she wouldn’t tell me. Knowing
      Morgan, though, I’d find out one way or another before too long. She never kept
      a secret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was already through the concert gates, waving at
      me to follow her in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly I flashed on the body in the locker
      room, again. I’d actually managed to forget about it for a little while, but
      now the image of its mouth hanging open came back to me. I’d kept glimpsing
      its teeth while I’d helped Ian carry it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some reason this
      made me nervous about sneaking into the concert. We weren’t kids any more, and
      I’d be mortified if I got caught now, as an adult, especially tonight. I even
      knew the woman collecting tickets and checking stamps. Her husband was one of
      the truckers at the company I worked for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan gave me a shrug
      from the other side of the gate. Then she impatiently waved me in again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hurry
      up!” she yelled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stepped forward, trying to keep as far from
      the counter as possible, holding up my wrist with its faint green <i>T</i>.
      I’d never been as good as Morgan was at playing things cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of
      course the woman collecting tickets recognized me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley! Hi!
      I thought you weren’t going to the concert?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hey Helen,” I smiled,
      scared. She already suspected me, I could tell. “Well, my friend bought me a
      ticket,” I said awkwardly. “We came in earlier? I just went out for a sec to
      say hi to my niece.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no idea where these lies were coming
      from, or how believable they were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well let’s see that stamp
      of yours.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My heart was pounding. This was so stupid. Someone
      had just died and I was about to get caught sneaking into a concert by some
      musician I’d never even heard of and whose bus had even blocked my car in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m
      gonna be late!” I joked nervously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helen took my hand and examined
      the stamp. This was it. I glanced around. What would she do? Were there security
      guards she would call? I saw one guy, arms folded, standing at the entrance
      to the grandstands. I was pretty sure he was already looking over at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That’s
      what I thought!” Helen declared, inspecting my stamp. “Ashley!” She frowned
      and clucked her tongue. “You’ve almost worn your stamp off already! I can barely
      see it. Here.” She plunked her rubber stamp into the inkpad and gave me a fresh
      <i>T. </i>“Enjoy!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as I was through the gate, Morgan grabbed
      my arm and hurried me toward to the grandstands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You totally
      thought fucking Helen Sandburg was going to arrest you or something, didn’t
      you!” She laughed at me. “I saw the look on your face! You did! Always such
      a <i>good kid</i>.” She squeezed my neck. “Ah, that’s why I love you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      hated that Morgan thought about me that way. But it was true. I let that ass-hole
      Jason treat me like shit. I let Shawn belittle me after I’d just wiped vomit
      off his shoes. And now I was afraid that sweet wouldn’t-accuse-a-fly-of-buzzing
      Helen Sandburg would turn me into the cops. It was a good thing Morgan loved
      me, however innocent she thought I was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was suddenly determined
      to get completely wasted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concert was packed. It was disorienting
      to see the rodeo grounds transformed into a country music venue and filled with
      so many people from out of town. I led Morgan all the way to the standing-only
      area in front of the stage. We must have missed all the opening acts because
      Bryce Tripp himself was already playing. He was sitting on a stool wearing boots
      and a sleeveless shirt, looking like an underwear model with a guitar and a
      cowboy hat. I thought maybe he was even wearing makeup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was
      singing some ballad that nobody seemed to know except for a small group of middle-aged
      women I didn’t recognize, each holding up a cigarette lighter and swaying idiotically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty
      much everybody else was at least as drunk as they were, but more restless. A
      couple of guys I recognized from Biggs, the next town over, started yelling
      at the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hey dick lick! Pick it up, pretty boy! Too fucking
      slow!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce Tripp seemed to get the hint. Next song he called
      out his backup band, slung on an electric guitar, and started playing a much
      faster song whose only lyrics I could catch were “beer” and “bullets.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Half
      the crowd was down in front of the stage dancing drunkenly. Morgan bought beers
      and managed to pour a shot’s-worth each of whiskey from her purse flask. “Boilermakers!”
      She yelled over the speakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could tell already that the concert
      wasn’t going to end well. There was just this feeling in the air. Too many guys
      who basically wanted to drink, and drink more, and then break whatever rule
      they could find to break. Halfway into his set, Bryce Tripp slowed it down again,
      this time playing a crooning love song. A guy nearby took the opportunity to
      slow-dance with this girl I vaguely recognized from the beer garden. He had
      his hands all over her, then he started really grabbing her ass. I was pretty
      sure she’d been with somebody else at the beer garden. It was actually kind
      of weird how the guy wasn’t just grabbing her ass but totally reaching around
      and down between her legs, and she was just letting him go at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s
      when I got knocked over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some guy had trampled into me, fists
      swinging. As I fell, his elbow caught me behind the ear. I spilled what was
      left of my second boilermaker and scraped my palm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ass hole!”
      Morgan screamed and tried to help me up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was just as the
      guy who’d knocked me down—it was the same guy I’d seen with the girl in the
      beer garden—punched the guy she was dancing with squarely in the face. But then
      yet another guy I’d never seen before pushed them both right back into us, and
      we got knocked over again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An all-out brawl broke lose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      and I crawled to the edge of the stage, and Bryce Tripp finally stopped playing.
      A security guard took over the microphone while a handful of rent-a-cops tried
      to stop the melee. I checked my palm, which was only barely bleeding, and my
      head, which felt fine, but this may have had a lot to do with how drunk I was
      at that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I looked up, Morgan was talking to Bryce Tripp.
      I couldn’t believe it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Why’d you stop playing?” she yelled out
      while the scuffle continued on, barely abated, behind her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was
      sure Bryce Tripp would just ignore her, but he actually smiled and said something.
      Neither of us could make it out over the bullhorn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What?” Morgan
      screamed. I hadn’t seen her this drunk in a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce Tripp
      smiled again and shook his head. I couldn’t believe it, but he actually approached
      us at the foot of the stage and kneeled down to talk to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“They
      won’t let me keep playing,” he said. “It’s actually in my contract.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      had these crazy icy-blue eyes. I honestly don’t think I’d ever seen anyone better
      looking from this close, in person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You know,” he added, and
      shrugged. “The ‘safety of the performer at risk’ and all that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      was in full flirting mode. “So you always do what <i>they</i> tell you to do?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She
      had this weird ability to flirt without making a total ass of herself, no matter
      how drunk she was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce Tripp laughed. He was even cuter with
      a full grin. I actually felt this wave of attraction pass over me when he spoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yeah,”
      he nodded. “I usually do pretty much what they tell me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      put on a pout and pretended like she’d lost interest. “Well, that’s a shame.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No,
      not really,” Bryce Tripp shot back, still grinning. “I get paid all the same.
      This is my third brawl in two months. Just means I get the night off. Which
      is fine by me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stood, reached into his pocket, and pulled
      out a stack of what looked like business cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Couple of backstage
      passes,” he said, handing one to Morgan and one to me. “Looks like I’m free
      for the evening. Why don’t you come on over and say hello.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then
      he just gave us this friendly wave and left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as he’d left
      the stage, Morgan clutched her pass and screamed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh my fucking
      God! How do we get back there?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a little security gate
      beside the stage which seemed to be the only way in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By then the
      brawl had shifted toward the grandstands and we were able to make our move.
      We had to avoid an inebriated trucker pinned to the ground by a couple of security
      cops, but we managed to race to the side of the stage without getting knocked
      over again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t stop laughing. I hadn’t forgotten the body,
      but I was so drunk by now, I actually didn’t care that someone had just died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
      little panicking security guard was the only person manning the backstage gate.
      He was so focused on the brawl, standing on his toes and yelling into his cell
      phone, that he just waved us in without even really looking at our passes. He
      was probably used to letting local girls with passes backstage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      area behind the stage was strangely empty. There were these couches set up outside,
      and a cold-cut buffet, and coolers of what I assumed to be beer, but no one
      was around. Bryce Tripp’s trailer—the same one that had blocked my car—was now
      pulled up alongside this sitting area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Bryce Tripp himself
      was nowhere to be seen. I don’t know what I expected, but not this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      grabbed a beer from a cooler and sat on the couch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just then someone
      came out of the trailer. A guy. He was dressed in tapered jeans and a fitted
      shirt and looked ready for an L.A. nightclub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He lowered his sunglasses,
      and it was only now that I realized fully that this was Bryce Tripp, the same
      guy who’d just been singing twangy country songs in a Stetson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How
      do you like my disguise?” he asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I can’t say it’s an improvement,”
      Morgan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He folded his glasses and stashed them in his vest
      pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So where we going?” he asked. “If I’m going to buy you
      drinks, you two have to lead the way. I’ve never been here before. Where are
      we, anyway? Muldoon? Is that what it’s called?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Muldoon,” I confirmed,
      stupidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan laughed. “Which means there’s only one place
      to go! Come on.”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">T</span>he
      Buckshot Bar is the single establishment where you can buy beer on tap year-round
      in Muldoon. During fair time it never closes, and it’s basically standing-room-only,
      twenty-four hours a day, all weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don’t think anyone recognized
      Bryce Tripp when we came in. He turned the head of just about every girl he
      passed when we all made our way inside, and at least a dozen half-sozzled guys
      sized him up. But he looked so different out of his western clothes that no
      one realized he was the same guy on all the concert posters. Everyone figured
      he was just someone’s out-of-towner friend, some pretty boy from the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,
      ladies,” he said, wedging himself into a place at the bar between me and Morgan
      on one said and Tuck Schroep, my second-grade teacher’s husband, on the other.
      “What’ll it be?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was already barely able to keep my balance,
      but I let him order me a whiskey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was while I was doing the
      shot that I saw Shawn at the back of the bar. He was nodding drunkenly at one
      of his friends from the mill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For just a moment I worried he’d
      see me shoulder-to-shoulder with this extremely attractive stranger, the only
      guy in the bar in skinny jeans, and get upset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in exactly
      the next moment, I <i>hoped</i> he’d see me. I thought again about his complete
      inability to help Ian with the body in the locker room, and the way he’d laughed
      at me with Jason. Fuck him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Nate!” I yelled at the bar tender,
      pounding my hand and drawing as much attention to myself as possible. “Three
      more Maker’s!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no idea if this worked because I lost sight
      of Shawn while a surge of a dozen people spilled in from the cancelled concert.
      I’m sure the bar was well past its legal capacity. I could hardly breathe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By
      the time our next round arrived, Tuck Schroep was talking at Bryce and Morgan
      from beneath his hairy white mustache.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“. . . Clean off!” he was
      saying, making a chopping motion with his hand. “That’s right. I’m telling you.
      Somebody’d cut his thingy clean off!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I realized he was talking
      about the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew the news of a mutilated corpse in the girls’
      locker room was going to spread like prairie fire, but not this fast. Mrs. Whipple
      must have told anyone within earshot after the football game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And
      now everyone was on edge. I could tell. People weren’t just drinking because
      it was fair time. People were nervous, afraid. Things like this didn’t ever
      happen in Muldoon. I’d never even seen Tuck Schroep drunk before, not ever,
      come to think of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What’s he talking about!” Bryce laughed.
      He couldn’t seem to figure out if Tuck was crazy or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t
      know,” I lied. I was desperate to come up with a way to change the subject.
      Before I could think of how, though, Tuck broke in again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fella
      was trying to rape one of the girls, I guess!” he declared. “One of the cheerleaders.
      I don’t know which one of them cut it off, but one of ‘em did. Well, good for
      them, I say.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone put a hand on my shoulder. At first I thought
      it was someone trying to pay Nate, but whoever it was kept his hand there and
      pulled a little, gently turning me around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How you holding up?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was Ian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I practically knocked Morgan over hugging him. “You’re
      already here! I didn’t think I’d see you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He looked at me a little
      warily. He’d changed clothes; he’d probably showered. He was wearing his Army
      hoodie. He glanced at Bryce, then back at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How you holding
      up?” he asked again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fine!” I yelled over the bar’s noise. “Fine!
      Totally fine. Drunk off my ass, but fine!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce Tripp held out
      his hand. “Hey I’m Bryce,” he said, charmingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian shook his
      hand. He was polite, but wary. “Ian.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was actually pretty drunk
      at that point, but I could see right away that Ian was the only person in the
      bar who recognized Bryce Tripp from the posters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Buy you a drink?”
      Bryce asked him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Nate!” Morgan yelled to the bartender before
      Ian could respond. “Four more!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian grinned at me for the first
      time since he’d said hello.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I did say I might have just one.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      raised his shot glass. “Well, then, to—where’d you say we are? Muldoon! Prettiest
      little place I’ve ever avoided getting my ass kicked. So far.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      laughed, we all clinked Bryce’s glass with ours, and I drank down yet another
      whiskey—who knows how many by that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that point, things
      start to get hazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember Morgan talking to Ian about bear
      hunting with her dad, and Ian just nodding and listening to her drunken blather
      because he was too nice to tell her just to shut the fuck up. I remember actually
      grabbing Bryce Tripp’s arm and peeling him away from Tuck Schroep—something
      I never would have done if I hadn’t been so totally wasted—and staggering with
      him in tow onto the insanely crowded dance floor. I think I remember Shawn watching
      us dancing, but I can’t say for certain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, I remember—just
      barely—asking Bryce if he smoked, and then I remember him buying cigarettes
      from the vending machine. I think I remember having one more shot at the bar
      and going outside to smoke, and I’m pretty sure I remember that Morgan actually
      talked Ian into having another shot with us. There was another moment outside—this
      one very hazy—when Bryce bummed someone’s last match, and he laughed when I
      told him he’d have to monkeyfuck me, which meant, I explained, lighting my cigarette
      from his. But I can barely remember this at all, and I can’t really say if it
      was before or after that round of shots with Morgan and Ian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And
      that’s it, really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest is totally gone. Anything else that
      happened that night is completely blacked out from my memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      next thing I remember is waking up alone in the Starlight Motel, without a phone,
      or a car, and, now, with night coming on.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>
      had no choice but to walk the half-mile from the motel to the fairgrounds, where
      I hoped my car would still be parked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the way there I still
      felt weirdly great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I kept expecting a massive hangover to hit
      me, but it never came. I didn’t even have to pee, and I wasn’t really thirsty
      at all. I honestly don’t think I’d ever felt more rejuvenated in my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was only when I reached the highway that I realized something was wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      had to be the Saturday evening of fair weekend, but there wasn’t a single car
      on the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traffic should have been bumper to bumper, even
      worse than it had been last night. Any other time of year, an empty highway
      would have been perfectly normal. But not tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I walked faster.
      My footsteps through the gravel at the road’s shoulder was the only sound I
      could hear. It occurred to me, hurrying along while the sun sank into the mountains
      way off in the west, that I hadn’t seen a single person since I’d woken up.
      Not one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lights at the rodeo arena were on. And most of the
      street lights too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as I approached the fairgrounds, all of
      the carnival rides were totally dark. The Ferris wheel’s motionless silhouette
      rose up over the feedlot’s corrugated tin roof. There was no blaring carnival
      music, no roar of souped-up engines at the Saturday-night destruction derby,
      no cheers from the grandstands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hopped the fence into the parking
      lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were only a few cars left. I was so relieved when I
      spotted my little gray sedan, parked all alone in the dimming evening light,
      that I practically ran to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d lost my set of keys along with
      my phone, but thank God Shawn had insisted that I keep a spare hidden under
      the battery. I popped the hood and found the extra key right where it should
      have been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the car door wasn’t locked. Which was odd, because
      if there was ever I time I’d be sure to lock my car door, it was during fair,
      especially if I’d parked in the public lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to get out
      of there as soon as I could and go home, or maybe to my parents’, or to Ian
      and Danielle’s, and to figure out what the fuck was going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried not to think about the unlocked door for now and I jammed the key into
      the ignition. Just as I put the car into drive I noticed something on the passenger
      seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a hoodie. A man’s. I kept my foot on the brake and
      held up the fabric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Ian’s black Army hoodie. The one I’d
      seen him wearing at the bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Ian had been in my car last night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried again to think as hard as I could about what had happened after we were
      all at the bar. But it was no use. I had no memory whatsoever of anything after
      that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the dimming light I almost didn’t even see that there
      was something else on the seat. But when I moved the hoodie aside, there it
      was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A gun. Ian’s gun. I recognized it right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      wasn’t like Ian was one of those guys who packed everywhere he went, but he
      must have been carrying it last night in the bar. And he must have had a reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      why would he have left his gun in my car? With the door unlocked?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      didn’t make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something was wrong. Something was really wrong.
      I had to get to Ian right away. I had to talk to him and find out what the hell
      was going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hit the gas and drove my little car as fast as
      I could to toward the fairground’s nearest exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exit was
      in the back, near the stockyard. On the way there I saw that everything at the
      carnival was totally shut down. All the food stalls were closed, and as far
      as I could tell, even the animals had been taken out of their pens. My headlights
      flooded the road and all of the motionless rides, but I didn’t see a single
      soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I reached the gate, it was blocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A
      pair of wooden police barriers spanned the entire road. What the fuck was going
      on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone knocked hard on my window. I almost screamed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ma’am?”
      It was a male voice, but it was too dark now to see who it was. Another couple
      of pounding knocks. “Can’t leave here, Ma’am.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a cop. He
      was knocking with his flashlight. I don’t know if I was more relieved that it
      was a cop and not someone trying to kill me or that it was simply another human
      being, the very first I’d seen that day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I rolled down the window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      eyes adjusted to the glare of the flashlight, and now I could see that the cop
      was Jason. Fucking great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m not authorized to let you through
      here, Ma’am.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Ma’am</i>? Who’s <i>Ma’am</i>? What the fuck,
      Jason?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley. Whatever. You can’t pass through here.” He was
      obviously still hung over, but this wasn’t stopping him from acting like an
      ass-hole cop now that he was on duty. “Vehicles can’t come or go until the search
      is over. Why are you even here? Why aren’t you at home?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m
      trying to <i>go</i> home,” I said. “Just let me out.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Can’t.
      Can’t let anyone in or out. We still haven’t caught those guys yet.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What
      guys?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Are you kidding me?” Jason leaned casually against my
      car and folded his arms. This enraged me even further. “The guys who attacked
      that girl. Where have you been?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately my thoughts leapt
      to Haley. “What girl?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t know.” Jason shrugged. “Some girl.
      Some kid. It was two guys who did it. We’re still looking for them. We’re combing
      the fairgrounds. It’ll take a little time. The whole place is locked down. Here
      and the high school both. How do you not know about all this? Everyone was supposed
      to be out by two-thirty last night. They were announcing it for hours.” Now
      he grinned that stupid smug grin of his. “Where were <i>you</i>?” He laughed.
      “You were fucking hammered last night! Having a little too much fun?” With this
      he gave a few rabbit-like thrusts of his pelvis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was too worried
      about Haley to care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Who was the girl, Jason? Just tell me who
      the girl was.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I told you I don’t know, Ashley. Maybe if you
      weren’t so shitfaced drunk last night you could have found out for yourself.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      the briefest of moments I thought about the gun under Ian’s hoodie. But I wasn’t
      stupid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to focus on getting home as soon as possible, then
      calling Danielle on the landline. All I cared about right now was making sure
      that Haley was okay. I tried to remind myself that there were probably hundreds
      of little girls at the fair last night. But if something had happened to Haley
      after she’d begged me to take her to the carnival, and I wasn’t there, I’d have
      to kill myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to stay calm. I had to. I couldn’t afford
      anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Look,” I said to Jason, trying to control my voice.
      “You know me. I’m obviously not a suspect. All you have to do is move that roadblock
      and let me through.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason didn’t stop leaning against my car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      grinned. Again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What’s the rush?” he said. “I mean, I can’t let
      you out. I told you that. And, hell, I sure could use some company.” Now he
      leaned in closer and lowered his voice. “Here I am, stuck out here all alone
      on a chilly evening. What’s the hurry?” He winked. “It’d be just like old times.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Let
      me the fuck out.” It was everything I could do not to scream. “Right now. Jason.
      Let me the fuck out. There’s no way this is even legal. Let me the fuck out
      right now.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason put his head through the open window and brought
      it close to mine. He sniffed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You been drinking? Ashley? Are
      you still drunk, maybe?” Now he put his finger under my chin and turned my face
      around toward his. He sniffed again. “I wonder if maybe you’re getting just
      a little belligerent. I wouldn’t want to have to detain you. But if I have to,
      I have to. It’d be for your own good.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t even think.
      I hadn’t ever been so enraged in my life. I just acted without planning. Suddenly
      I found that I’d slammed my foot into the gas pedal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My car heaved
      forward. Jason spun around, and the next thing I saw of him was just his hand
      flopping out through the window. I’m not sure, but I may have broken his arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      didn’t have much time to wonder about it, though, because my bumper hit the
      two wooden police barricades. I lurched forward with the impact, and I worried
      for a moment that I might not make it through. But I just kept my foot on the
      gas, and my little car surged, knocked the barriers aside, and sent them tumbling
      onto the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked into the rear-view mirror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      taillights were just bright enough to illuminate Jason limping forward. He raised
      his gun with one hand. I ducked and kept speeding forward as fast as my car
      would go. But I was already too far away; he lowered his gun without firing,
      and I turned the corner onto the completely empty highway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I drove
      faster and faster, trying to catch my breath, maxing out at a little over ninety
      miles an hour. The road was completely empty. The night was completely dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And
      then I felt it: someone’s hand on my shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment I
      tried to reason that this was impossible, that maybe my seat belt had tightened
      when I’d crashed through the barricades. But I wasn’t wearing my seat belt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone
      really was in the back of my car—had <i>been</i> <i>in</i> the back of my car
      this whole time—and now they were touching my shoulder!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt
      an index finger slowly rise up the skin on my neck. Very lightly, it touched
      my ear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was driving way too fast to take my eyes off the road.
      My car was shuddering from the speed. Without really thinking about it, I held
      on tight to the wheel and reached for the gun. I felt its metallic grip at the
      tips of my fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I didn’t grab it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this
      is what’s really weird. This is what I still can’t figure out. Because more
      than anything else right then I was truly afraid that Haley had been hurt, or
      worse. I was also consumed by worry that I may have cheated on Shawn. And now
      I was truly, utterly terrified at the fact that someone was in the back of my
      car, running their finger along the softest part of my neck. And yet, despite
      all of this, that weirdly euphoric sensation of invincibility that had overcome
      me after waking up still hadn’t gone away. If anything, it was suddenly becoming
      more intense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whoever was behind me drew their hand down over
      my shoulder, slowly across my ribs and abdomen, then plunged it, very softly,
      into my underwear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still had no idea who it was, or how I could
      be so weirdly aroused at a moment like this. I flashed on dancing with Bryce
      Tripp last night, and lighting my cigarette from his, and his icy blue eyes,
      and I wondered if only someone as confident as he was could do anything so audacious
      as this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then I remembered something else while still trying
      to slow my car down without wrecking it. It hadn’t been Morgan who’d talked
      Ian into having one more shot with us, like I’d thought earlier. It had been
      <i>me</i>. Morgan had been goading him, but it wasn’t until <i>I’d</i> spoken
      up that Ian finally glanced in my direction, and, for just a moment, he gave
      me this accidental look that seemed to say <i>I’d do anything you ask me to
      do, anything at all</i>. Then he drank down his second shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      took my hand from the gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, I clutched the fabric of Ian’s
      hoodie in the seat beside me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whoever it was in the back seat
      of my car right now, reaching even deeper into my underwear while I tried to
      keep the car on the road, it was probably more likely that it was anyone in
      the world other than Ian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet no matter how well I knew it
      couldn’t possibly be him, for a moment I <i>hoped</i> somehow that it was.</p>\r\n</div>"

    - "<div class=\"blog_text\"><p>I slept <i>so</i> well last night. I mean, yeah,
      I was terrified that I’d actually put the first part of my novel into the world.
      For a moment I worried that I’d made a huge mistake. I even almost took it down.
      After all, the story’s not exactly family friendly. Ha ha. But I’d been working
      crazy hard on writing it over the past week, and I was exhausted. I knew that
      people would probably hate my writing, but, still, after my moment of panic,
      I started to feel kinda good that I’d posted it as I drifted off. Really good,
      actually. Even if it was just on this blog. So I let myself feel a little happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      case anyone actually starts reading this, I should probably say a little about
      who I am. That’s what you’re supposed to do, right? Well, I guess I'm just a
      girl from a small town who loves really good stories. My teacher told me I should
      try to publish my writing one day, so that’s what I’m trying to do — though
      suspense thrillers about a plague that turns people into crazed sex-fiends probably
      wasn't exactly what she had in mind! Ever since I learned about this stupid
      medical condition I came down with, though, I've been stuck at home without
      much else to do. And I really love writing. It's an escape, and it makes me
      feel better about things. I'll keep publishing new parts until the series ends
      — or until my dad finds out what I'm doing. (If he ever sees any of this, he'll
      kill me.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If by some miracle anyone out there starts reading this,
      it would be awesome to hear from you. Tweet or message @BaileySimms. </p>\r\n\r\n<p

    - "<div class=\"novel_text\"><p><span class=\"first_letter\">I</span> really wasn’t
      the kind of person who would ever act like this—or even <i>think</i> like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First
      of all, I wouldn’t ever seriously consider sleeping around on my husband, even
      if maybe our marriage had fallen into a pretty deep rut. And I’m definitely
      not the kind of person who would ever actually get, well, just a little bit,
      um, <i>wet</i>, at the touch of a stranger’s hand on my shoulder. It was true
      that I <i>liked</i> sex, just like everybody else does. And for a while I really
      liked it, especially with Shawn when we were younger and things had been going
      well between us and we were like best friends. But I wouldn’t <i>ever</i> let
      anyone put their hand deep into my underwear while I was careening down a highway
      in the dark, probably not even Shawn in high school. And what I <i>absolutely</i>
      wouldn’t ever do while a stranger’s fingertip was beginning to press slightly
      inside me would be to actually <i>hope</i> that it was my sister’s husband who
      was doing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or at least I thought I wasn’t that kind of person.
      Not until now. And I wasn’t sure how I felt about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A voice
      whispered behind me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn’t what I expected. It wasn’t Ian’s
      voice, that’s for sure. And it definitely wasn’t any guy I knew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’re
      <i>wet</i>,” it said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there was laughter. Shocked laughter.
      It was Morgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh my God!” she said, no longer whispering and
      now laughing out loud. She jerked her hand out of my pants. “You actually got
      a little into that, I think!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally I was able to slow the car
      to a reasonable speed and I quickly turned my head, just enough to glimpse the
      outline of Morgan’s face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What the fuck are you doing?” I snapped
      my head back around to keep my eyes on the road, then glanced in the rear-view
      mirror. “Morgan! What are you doing in my car?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was still so
      startled that I could barely process the fact that the person who had just had
      their hand down my pants had been my best friend. And it really weirded me out.
      So maybe one time at a lame-ass football party in high school some of the guys
      had pressured us into kissing each other, and we’d gone along just to prove
      we weren’t prudes. But otherwise Morgan had never done anything like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She
      couldn’t stop laughing. “Who did you think I <i>was</i>!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      scared the shit of me!” I said, trying to sound more annoyed than flustered
      and pretending I hadn’t been turned on. “Morgan? What the hell? I almost wrecked
      the car! Your hands are like ice! What the fuck are you doing in here?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That
      was the funniest thing ever!” She kept laughing. “I thought you were so scared,
      at first. But obviously you weren’t <i>just</i> scared!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still
      giggling, she climbed over the seat. I pulled Ian’s hoodie out of the way, careful
      to keep the gun wrapped inside, before she sat down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“But, wow,
      actually,” she said, “I mean where did your tummy go? There’s like nothing there.”
      She reached over and felt my abdomen. “I didn’t know you were trying to lose
      weight, Ash. Whatever you’re doing, it’s working.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was still
      flustered, and I couldn’t understand why Morgan would decide to hide in my car
      and then try to reach into my pants out of the blue. It was bizarre. Nothing
      was making any sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’ve been spending too much time with
      Jason,” I mumbled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even Jason’s influence couldn’t quite explain
      how Morgan was acting. I was still basically clueless about whatever weird shit
      had been happening since last night, but obviously things had gone very wrong
      in Muldoon, and I had a feeling they were going to get worse. Yet Morgan was
      still laughing as if everything was perfectly normal and we’d just been out
      drinking together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Can’t be because of Jason,” she said, now
      catching her breath from laughing and settling into the passenger seat. “I broke
      it off with him last night. He definitely wasn’t happy about it. I’ve been avoiding
      him. Sorry I didn’t back you up just now. Really, Ash. I’m sorry. I just didn’t
      want him to see me in the car after everything.” She slapped my arm with the
      back of her hand. “But that was crazy awesome what you just did! He’s such an
      ass hole! I bet he shit his pants when you broke through that roadblock. I mean,
      he should totally have to pay if you have to fix anything on your car. I bet
      you could even get him fired, after all that pervy shit he said to you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      put her head in her hands. I could see by the dashboard lights that her hair
      was unbrushed, and that she was still wearing the same clothes she’d worn last
      night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were quite the pair. She looked like she’d just woken
      up too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m still so fucking hung over,” she groaned, then she
      forced herself to straighten up. “So are you gonna tell me, or what?\" she asked
      suddenly. \"What happened to you last night? I was worried.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d
      been hoping that it would be Morgan who could help <i>me</i> answer this question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      had no idea how much she knew, but I wasn’t quite ready to tell her that I’d
      completely blacked out and woke up in a room at the Starlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      first,” I said. At least having Morgan in the car would help take my mind off
      worrying about Haley while I drove home. Now that I was recovering from her
      weird prank, I was actually feeling incredibly glad to see her. “How’d it go
      with you and Bryce Fancy-Ass Tripp?” I asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Me?</i>” Morgan
      sounded genuinely surprised. “I couldn’t even get him to notice me,” she said.
      “Not after we got to the bar, anyway. <i>You</i> were the one he couldn’t take
      his eyes off.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I doubt that,” I said. “So I guess you didn’t
      get to see the inside of his bus?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Seriously? <i>You</i> were
      the one who disappeared with him. You should have seen how worried Ian got before
      he went out looking for you.” Morgan let out a little laugh. “But after how
      you were dancing with him, I gotta say. I’ve been telling you all this time
      to think about leaving Shawn, but I kinda thought maybe you were finally going
      for it. And, I mean, Bryce Tripp’s not a bad a way to do it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She
      glanced over at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, you know me.” I shrugged. “I’m the
      good kid. You said it last night. I couldn’t do something like that to Shawn.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      kept my eyes on the road. I could feel Morgan staring at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Okay,”
      she said. “So, then, what <i>did</i> you do after we split up? I was looking
      for you. I was worried, Ash.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Worried? Why? I just ended up
      back at the beer garden for a little while.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t like lying
      to Morgan, but I was too confused about what had actually happened to just tell
      her the truth. I’d explain later, after I’d got my bearings. She’d forgive me.
      I hoped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Then after that,” I said, “I was at the campground with
      some people I met from Boulder, or somewhere. I can hardly remember, actually.
      It’s your fault you got me so drunk. Then Ian found me and took me home.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Really,”
      Morgan said, sounding suspicious. “Ian drove you home?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn’t
      sure if she knew I was lying or if now she was trying to suggest that I had
      something going on with Ian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“But what about you?” I tugged at
      her unbuttoned jacket sleeve and laughed. “What did <i>you</i> get up to?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just
      stayed at the bar, pretty much. They actually ran out of beer on tap around
      one. So everyone just had more whiskey.” She rubbed her eyes, then let out a
      long yawn. “When the police started making everyone leave, I couldn’t find you,
      and the phones were all jammed, so I just went to your car. I was gonna wait
      for you, then I guess I fell asleep. I tried to get out of the fairgrounds in
      the morning, but they wouldn’t let me. I was so hung over I just went back to
      your car and tried to sleep it off. I figured you’d show up eventually.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So
      do you have any idea what happened last night?” I asked. “I mean, have you heard
      anything new?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Not a fucking clue. Some carney died at the high
      school, and later some kid got attacked at the fair.” She shrugged. “That’s
      all anyone’s saying. I was kinda wondering if Ian filled you in on any of the
      details today. He must know more.” Morgan had that same tone in her voice again
      when she mentioned Ian, but now I couldn’t tell if she was suspicious or feeling
      guilty about something she wasn't saying. “He didn’t say anything to you?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      thought about Ian’s Army hoodie and his gun in my car, and Morgan sleeping there.
      Had she been with him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course she hadn't. I didn’t know why
      my thoughts even went there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I haven’t talked to Ian,” I said,
      and I realized I had no idea if this was true or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a small
      town like Muldoon, word about anything gets out fast. Everyone at the bar last
      night already knew about the body at the high school. So it was hard to believe
      that no one seemed to know anything at all about the girl who’d been attacked,
      or who’d done it. I couldn’t figure out why the police would keep information
      like this secret. I also couldn’t figure out why they would be blocking people
      from going in <i>and</i> out of the fairgrounds. It didn’t make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      headlights reached a car parked on the side of the road up ahead. It was the
      first car I’d seen anywhere near the highway. Its taillights’ red glow dimly
      illuminated a hay field that stretched out into the darkness from the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As
      I drew closer, I could see that both of the car’s front doors were wide open.
      I couldn’t make out what kind of car it was. As far as I could tell, no one
      was sitting inside, and I couldn’t see anyone standing around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally
      I would have slowed down in case someone was in trouble or hurt. But after everything
      that had been happening, the empty car was unnerving. I sped up just a little
      and passed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan watched the car out the window as we drove
      by, and now she turned around in her seat to look behind us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What
      was that?” For some reason she was whispering. “Did you see that? Out in the
      field?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Wait. Go back, go back. What was
      that? Something was out in the field.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really, really just wanted
      to go home. I wasn’t looking forward to confronting Shawn—I still had no idea
      what I was going to tell him about where I'd been last night. At least when
      I reached my house, though, I could call my sister and make sure Haley was safe.
      But I was born and raised in a small rural town, and in small rural towns you
      don’t just pass a car on the side of the road without making sure everything’s
      okay. What if someone needed help? If I was hurt on the side of the road and
      someone just drove by, I’d feel awful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I slowed down. I started
      to loop the car around to make a U-turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hurry,” Morgan whispered.
      She tapped the window, pointing into the darkness beyond the abandoned car.
      “Out there. Shine the lights out there.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was about fifty
      yards from the parked car, I turned the wheel so the headlights would shine
      in the general direction Morgan had been pointing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a hay
      field. Pretty much just like any of the other thousands of hay fields in northern
      Colorado. The stubble was short. It had been cut recently. Big round bales of
      rolled hay were scattered as far as my headlights reached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There!
      There!” Morgan yelled through her whispering voice. “Just turn back a little.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      maneuvered my car so the headlights pointed toward the part of the field they’d
      just passed over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I searched the field again. But still I couldn’t
      see anything. There was just the abandoned car with its doors open and its lights
      on, and, out beyond, hundreds of hay bales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh my <i>God</i>,”
      Morgan whispered. “Who <i>is</i> that?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still couldn’t see anything.
      The tone of Morgan’s voice was scaring me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Where?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>There!</i>”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      nodded stiffly toward the field as if she were trying to avoid making any fast
      movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally I saw what she was looking at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d
      been scanning the field itself, searching for someone standing or maybe lying
      in the stubble. I hadn’t looked on top of the bales themselves. They were almost
      six feet tall, and I knew from experience as a kid that they weren’t easy to
      climb up onto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But someone had. Two people, in fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On
      top of one of the bales, about three rows from the road, I could just make out
      a man’s back. It was bare. And there were a pair of equally bare women’s legs
      wrapped around him. From this distance I could just tell that they were swaying
      back and forth together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It had to have been a couple of high
      school kids having sex. They must have been enjoying themselves, because I was
      shining my headlights right toward them now, and they weren’t letting up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      put her hand over her mouth and giggled. “Who <i>is</i> that?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just
      some kids,” I said, not quite sharing Morgan’s interest. “Fair’s cancelled.
      What else are they going to do around here? Let’s go. Obviously our help isn’t
      exactly needed.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No, wait!” Morgan said, still giggling. “It
      isn’t kids! Look! Just pull up a little closer.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to look
      closer, but I couldn’t make out anything I hadn’t seen before. “I need to get
      home. I’m tired.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just a little closer! Ash, seriously, it’s
      not kids.” Morgan cupped her hands around her eyes and peered out the window.
      “Who <i>is </i>that?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled up a little farther. I felt kind
      of guilty invading these people's privacy like this, but now I was curious about
      what Morgan thought she saw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled within about thirty yards
      from the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was right. It definitely wasn’t kids. I could
      see the man’s back more clearly now. He was older. He was rhythmically thrusting
      away, then for a moment he threw his head back and I could see that his hair
      was gray. And so was the woman's.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh my God,” Morgan squealed
      quietly. “They’re not even stopping! It’s like they don’t even see us. Can you
      tell who it is?” Morgan asked through a fit of suppressed giggling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      man threw his head back once again, the woman’s legs clutched tightly around
      his ass, and now he arched his back. They whole hay bale shuddered. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh
      god,” I said, disgusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Can you tell who it is?” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      had no idea. It was too far away to tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man rolled over
      onto his side, then his back, managing to keep his balance atop the hay bale.
      I couldn’t believe it, but now the woman threw her fleshy leg up and straddled
      him. She was plump, and her big ass shined white in the headlights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh
      my <i>God</i>!” Morgan squealed. “They’re going again!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman
      just continued on swaying, completely oblivious to our presence, or, somehow,
      they just didn't care that we were there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was going on? Something
      was off. I didn’t know any middle aged people who would ever act like this,
      especially not after everyone knew that someone had just died at the high school
      and half the town was under lockdown. And it wasn’t even a full moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What’s
      <i>happening</i> around here?” I said out loud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was suddenly
      aware of the night's darkness surrounding the car. I also remembered the weirdly
      charged rush of erotic energy I felt when Morgan reached between my legs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was scared. Something wasn’t right. I wasn’t sure what it was exactly, but I
      was scared. I needed to drop Morgan off, collect myself, and get things straightened
      out. In fact, what I really wanted to do was talk to Ian as soon as possible.
      Whatever was happening, he would know what to do better than anyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      put my car in reverse, turned around, and started back down the highway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley!”
      Morgan pleaded. “I wanted to see who that was! I couldn’t even see the car.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      kept driving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, whatever.” Morgan settled back into her seat.
      She was too hung over to put up much of a fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment
      she looked at me as I drove, and I could tell she was as perplexed as I was
      at everything that had been happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She shook her head slowly.
      “What is <i>going on</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">M</span>organ
      lived in a tiny rental house on the Hershel ranch, the property that had abutted
      my family’s ranch for generations. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we were younger, sometimes
      Morgan and I used to sneak into the little clapboard house to drink. Mr. Hershel
      was one of those old classic grizzled cowboys, but he was really softhearted.
      He used to tear up whenever he had to slaughter cattle. He knew we used his
      house, and I’m sure he smelled the scent of cigarette smoke we left behind,
      but he never said anything to my parents about it. He even had the place fixed
      up a little before he started renting it to Morgan, and he charged her practically
      nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I pulled up to drop Morgan off, I eyed the little
      house’s dark porch apprehensively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Are you gonna be okay?” I
      asked her. “You can stay with me and Shawn, if you want. Maybe until everything
      settles down?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan slapped my knee. “You’re a sweetheart,”
      she said. “But I just want to get into my own bed and sleep. I’ll be fine.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      sure?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ash. Of course.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She opened the door and
      stepped out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,” I said. “Call the house number if you need
      anything. I lost my phone.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh, shit,” Morgan said. “Really?”
      Then she laughed. “What a night. I’ll be fine. Call me tomorrow.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She
      closed the car door. I kept my headlights shining on her porch until she was
      inside and had the lights turned on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house I rent with Shawn
      isn’t far past my parents’ ranch. I was there in a couple of minutes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>None
      of the lights were on. My house was as dark as Morgan’s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn’s
      pickup must have been inside the garage, because the driveway was empty. I hurried
      to the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The door was locked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We almost never
      locked our front door. I knocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I waited. I knocked again, louder,
      and this time I called Shawn’s name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing. My husband wasn’t
      home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn was <i>always</i> at home if he wasn’t working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried not to panic. I’d been so apprehensive about confronting him that I’d
      just assumed he’d be there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got back into my car and drove straight
      to Ian and Danielle’s house, which was only a couple of miles past ours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      there were no lights on at their place either. Their door was locked too, and
      when I knocked I was met only with a deep, disquieting silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      suddenly regretted not making Morgan come home with me. I don’t think I’d ever
      felt more alone. The sky was perfectly clear and moonless, and all of the stars
      shined down on me icily as I walked back to my little car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      parents’ house was my last bet. I tried not to think about the possibility of
      finding their place abandoned and silent too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I drove all the
      way back up the highway, still not passing a single car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I turned
      of the road and drove under the big <i>Travis Ranch</i> sign spanning the dirt
      road. I’d always thought the sign was so tacky and worn out, but now I found
      it mildly comforting in the dark of night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old farmhouse I
      grew up in sits just over a low rise. When followed the road up the hillside,
      the house’s upstairs windows became visible first. None of them were lit. I
      braced myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as I reached the top of the rise, I could see
      vehicles crowding my parents’ driveway. The front porch light was on. Shawn’s
      truck was there, and so was Ian’s SUV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d never been so happy
      to be home. I sped down the driveway and pulled up behind my dad’s hay truck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then
      I remembered Haley, and what had happened last night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What if
      everyone had gathered here at my mom and dad’s because it really had been Haley
      who’d been attacked at the fair? What if she’d been hurt, or worse? And what
      if while all this had gone on while I’d been out partying, sleeping around with
      who knew who, and out of reach all day?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew I was probably
      overreacting, but I ran up the steps and threw open the front door. I burst
      through the entryway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing I saw was Haley, lying at
      the bottom of the staircase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her head was resting against the
      lowest stairs. She was in her pajamas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In each of her hands was
      a small bronze horse. These were the prizes at the horse racing pinball game
      at the fair. Every time you won, you traded up for a bigger horse. My parents
      must have taken her to the carnival last night, then brought her home, as planned,
      safe a sound, long before the attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Aunt Ashley!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      niece sprang to her feet and ran towards me, a toy horse in each hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“She’s
      here!” Haley shouted. “Aunt Ashley’s here!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knelt down and right
      away, before even hugging me, Haley sat on my knee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Look,” she
      said, carefully displaying her pair of bronze horses as if they were small birds
      perched in her hands. “I got one, and grandpa got one.” She whispered, “But
      he gave his to me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad rushed into the entryway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d
      never seen him look this way. He had this expression of utter relief when he
      saw me. I’d had no idea what I’d been putting them all through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      was in the same kind of striped farmer’s shirt and faded jeans he always wore,
      his boots off in the house, and his eyes were misty as he strode toward me and
      put his arms around me. I could smell the hay dust on him, just like I always
      could whenever he used to hug me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh, thank God,” he said. “You’re
      here. You’re here.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now my mom appeared, and right behind her
      came Danielle and Ian. Even Tyler slouched over for my big return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone
      had been waiting for me. I hadn’t even considered that anyone besides Shawn
      would know I’d been gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad let go of me, and now my mom
      stepped forward, her arms folded. I could tell she was waging an inner battle
      between feeling relieved and being totally pissed at me, and it looked like
      the being-totally-pissed-at-me side was winning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I sure hope
      you have a good explanation for all this,” she said. My mom was small, but tough,
      especially during moments when she had to be emotionally strong. She gave me
      a quick hug, then she held on to both of my shoulders. “Do you know how worried
      Shawn’s been?” she whispered, glancing upstairs. “I’ve never seen him so sick
      with worry.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just then my husband appeared at the top of the stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      looked almost as if he’d been crying, and he was as pale as he’d been in the
      locker room the night before. His expression actually reminded me of the days
      after his accident, and the endless months he'd spent in the hospital with pins
      holding his spinal column together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn’t say anything. For
      a moment he just stared down at me, folding his arms around his now-pudgy frame,
      and I just stared back up at him, not knowing what to say, and everyone else
      just watched silently. I realized I’d been holding out hope that somehow, for
      some reason, it would turn out that it had been Shawn who I’d been with in the
      motel last night. I’d hoped that we’d both gotten so drunk that maybe on whim
      we’d just run off to the Starlight to make up for all the lost intimacy we’d
      been missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now even that remote possibility was gone. If
      Shawn had been worrying about me all day, that meant he didn't know I was at
      the motel. I’d cheated on him. I still had no idea who I’d slept with last night,
      but now I was sure that it wasn’t my husband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t know what
      else to do other than to just start talking. I couldn’t stand everyone just
      staring at us. There was no way I could tell my family the truth, so I started
      making things up which I hoped were half-way believable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I got
      stuck inside the fairgrounds,” I explained. “I’m so sorry. I realized I’d left
      my phone at the bar when they started evacuating everyone.” My whole family
      just kept staring at me, listening, so I just kept talking. “I ran back to look
      for my phone, but the police wouldn’t even let me back into the Buckshot. By
      the time I made it all the way back to my car, they were already closing up
      the gates at the fairground. They wouldn’t let me out. I had to sleep in my
      car. It was only this evening when I finally talked Jason Gibbs into letting
      me leave.” I glanced up at Shawn, who had now sat down at the top of the staircase.
      “I have no idea what’s going on around here.” I felt myself starting to cry,
      but I got control of myself. I swallowed and took a deep breath. “I haven’t
      even really talked to anyone all day. I don’t understand. What’s been happening?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      mom was feeling a little more generous now. She gave me her signature sideways
      hug and started rubbing my shoulder. Ian cleared his throat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Tyler,”
      Ian said. “Take your sister upstairs please.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Why?” Haley asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      didn’t say anything. He just raised his eyebrows sternly and Haley immediately
      dashed upstairs. Tyler followed. Ian took me by the shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Let’s
      go outside,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I let him lead me out the door. We sat on
      the porch swing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We don’t know much more than you do about what's
      going on, Ash. To be honest. There’s a lot we don’t know. It’s not good though.
      I can tell you that much. It’s not just the fairgrounds and the high school.
      There are roadblocks on all the highways coming in and out of town. I haven’t
      been able to get any answers.” He turned around and looked into the house. He
      was obviously worried about his kids. “There’s not a damn thing on the news,”
      he whispered. “None of the stations have picked anything up yet.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“They
      won’t let any of us leave town? At all?” I knew things were going badly, but
      I never dreamed it could be as big as this. “How is that even legal?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s
      not,” Ian said. “But they’re doing it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Why, though?” I asked.
      “I don’t understand. Just to find this guy who attacked a little girl? I mean,
      obviously they have to catch him, but none of this makes sense.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      leaned back in the chair and took a deep breath. I could feel the weight of
      his body in the sway of the porch swing. He glanced inside the house again and
      lowered his voice even further. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s not just that, Ash. They’ve
      got that little girl at the hospital. The one who was attacked. When I went
      back there last night there were armed guards all around her room. These guys
      were from way out of town. Maybe out of state. Not cops, military. Some kind
      of Special Ops or something.” Ian lowered his voice even further. “And they
      got him. They got the guy. They killed him. They already <i>killed</i> the guy
      who attacked the girl.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian stared at me for a second, unsure
      what to say, maybe unsure if he’d told me too much already. I knew he hadn’t
      shared any of this with Danielle. And, honestly, I wasn’t sure why he was telling
      me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So, what’s this mean?” I asked, keeping my voice low. “What’s
      going on then?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“All I can say is that I’m sure there’s a lot
      more going on than we know at this point.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started to cry. I
      couldn’t hold it back any more. Ian didn’t try to comfort me, which I was thankful
      for. He just sat there as the tears spilled down my cheeks and I tried to process
      everything he was telling me. I still didn’t understand what all of this meant,
      but for some reason it made me feel even more guilty about cheating on Shawn.
      It felt like such a small and stupid thing to have done, especially now. And
      I was worried that Ian knew more than he was telling me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I blacked
      out last night,” I confessed at last. “There are a lot of hours I don’t remember
      at all. The truth is I don’t remember much of anything after the bar.” I turned
      to look at him. “But I found your stuff in my car.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian searched
      my eyes. There was something in his look that told me he definitely <i>did </i>know
      more than he was saying, but he also looked almost relieved when I told him
      I'd blacked out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You don’t remember anything at all?” he asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m
      so stupid.” I tried to dry my eyes. \"I haven’t drunk that much since high school.
      Everything’s pretty much a complete blank.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I went out looking
      for you after you disappeared at the bar,” Ian said. “I couldn’t find you anywhere.
      To be honest, I think I was even more worried than Shawn’s been.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      wouldn’t look at me. Ian just kept folding and unfolding his hands and staring
      at them. He cleared his throat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“After they starting evacuating
      everyone,” he whispered, “I was worried about you. Really worried. You know?
      I didn’t have time to go to the motel, so I looked for your car in the lot.”
      He shrugged. “I figured eventually you’d make it back to your car. I didn’t
      want you to be cold. And I wanted to make sure you'd be safe. You still have
      the gun, right?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I nodded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Good.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian's
      phone rang while he nodded back distractedly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was used to Ian
      always getting calls, but this time when the ringer chimed it really startled
      me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I saw the name for the incoming call flash on the screen before
      he picked up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Morgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was screaming.
      She was screaming so loud I could hear her the sound of her voice as soon as
      Ian answered. She was screaming for help. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">W</span>e
      jumped into my little car. It was blocking all the other cars in; we had no
      choice but to use mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got into the passenger’s seat to let
      Ian drive, which was a good thing, because he flew around the dirt-road corners
      way faster than I’d ever be able go without losing control and rolling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      had to hold tight to the handle grip around every turn all the way there. Still,
      I managed to pull Ian’s gun from where I’d stashed it between the seats. I had
      no idea if the safety was on or off, but I held on to the gun as tightly as
      I held onto the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somehow, in the middle of all of this, I
      flashed on what he’d just said to me on the porch swing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He’d
      said he stashed the gun in my car because he<i> didn’t have time to go to the
      motel</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How did you know I was at the motel?” I asked as he
      skidded onto the long driveway leading to Morgan’s house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      said you <i>didn’t have time to go to the motel</i> before leaving the gun in
      my car,” I yelled over the sound of the gravel hitting the wheel wells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley,
      I didn’t know where you were. I said I couldn’t find you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      said something about a motel!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was racing toward Morgan’s house,
      and we were almost there, but he took his eyes off the road just long enough
      to give me a hard look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Listen to me,” he said decisively. “I
      don’t care what I may have said. I don’t know anything about any motel.”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">W</span>e skidded right up to Morgan’s gate.
      We both leapt out of the car and raced up the front steps. The house lights
      were on. I didn’t loosen my grip on the gun for a second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      was still screaming. But her cries were more ragged now, more tired and defeated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As
      we passed through the living room I made sure the safety was off. I knew that
      I would have to shoot whoever was making my best friend wail with such an awful,
      suffering sound. I couldn’t even let myself think what Morgan must have been
      going through, or what exactly was happening to her. I just knew I was prepared
      to kill whoever was causing her to make that sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was in
      the bedroom. We could hear her crying out from behind the door, but it was locked.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian slammed his shoulder into the door, and the wood splintered,
      but it stayed shut. He backed up and slammed into it again, even harder this
      time, and now the handle broke out of the frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The door whipped
      open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only twenty-four hours earlier I’d helped Ian carry a dead
      body whose penis had been gruesomely mutilated. But what I saw in Morgan’s room
      was more horrifying than anything I’d ever seen. It was horrifying on so many
      levels that at first my brain just kind of shut down and I didn’t understand
      what I was seeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan was on her back, lying atop her tiny
      writing desk, and bent backwards in what looked like an excruciatingly painful
      position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was completely naked. And she was bleeding. Her
      nose was covered in blood; her eyebrow was split. Patches of smeared blood ran
      from her face, down over her breasts, and all the way to her pubic hair. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And
      standing over her was Mr. Hershel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could barely comprehend that
      this was the same man who my mom always called the “gentle cowboy,” who had
      been my closest neighbor throughout my childhood, who had even once taught me
      how to ride his old graying mare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And he too was completely naked.
      Or almost completely naked. As he spun around to see who had just crashed through
      the door, he was wearing just an old leather holster. The belt was fastened
      around his otherwise bare hips, and inside the holster pouch, which was dangling
      down against his thigh, was no six-shooter but a very modern-looking handgun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan’s
      blood soaked his tanned, weathered face and his bare white chest. And his penis
      was erect. It was standing upright so that its pointy head hovered just in front
      of his belt buckle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I gagged. But I didn’t drop the gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      was still crying out in agony, which I hoped was a good sign only because she
      hadn’t yet been beaten unconscious. But there was absolutely no question that
      Mr. Hershel had been raping her. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now he planted a leathery hand
      between her breasts, holding her down, and Morgan screamed again. Mr. Hershel
      was fast, but his movements were feverishly stilted. It was almost as though
      someone were controlling him with strings. He kept fiercely twitching his head
      to one side and stamping his heel as though his entire body were itching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      with his free hand, he drew his gun and pointed it right my face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      dove at him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Ian’s shoulder reached Mr. Hershel’s chest,
      Mr. Hershel fired his gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment I was sure he’d hit Ian
      in the top of his head, but he must have missed, because as Mr. Hershel toppled
      backward under the weight of Ian’s body blow, Ian immediately tried to wrestle
      the gun from his blood-soaked hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Hershel didn’t utter a
      word. He just kept breathing at the pace of a dog’s panting, without stopping.
      His whole body was heaving with every breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Ian was able
      to pry the gun from his fingers, Mr. Hershel pulled away and brought the butt
      of his gun down hard right behind Ian’s ear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian tumbled backwards,
      dazed, and fell at my feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew this was it. I knew this was
      the moment I had to pull the trigger. I was already aiming right between Mr.
      Hershel’s eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I couldn’t do it. Whatever strength I’d summoned
      to help Ian carry the mutilated body from the locker room without vomiting was
      all the strength I possessed. This was different. This was too much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr.
      Hershel grabbed onto Morgan’s ankle and pulled her off the table. She cried
      out again as she fell awkwardly on her shoulder. She made a muted, coughing
      cry as she hit the floor. Mr. Hershel held tightly to her foot, twisting her
      leg up away from her body like he was dragging a club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And still
      I couldn’t pull the trigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was so ashamed. As certain as I’d
      been a moment earlier that I was going to kill whoever I found hurting Morgan,
      now I was just as certain that I couldn’t bring myself to end the life of the
      man I’d grown up next door to, no matter what he was doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      felt myself letting out a sob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard the heavy blast of Mr.
      Hershel’s gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was sure, in the next moment, that I was dead.
      Everything was black. I was lying on the floor. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not because
      I’d been shot. Mr. Hershel hadn’t even fired his gun. This fact dawned on me
      slowly as I opened my eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What had happened was that Ian had
      grabbed the gun from my hand, knocking me over in the process, and had shot
      Mr. Hershel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A massive wound had opened up on his shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      as if nothing had happened to him at all, Mr. Hershel lunged at Ian, toppling
      him over. Now he held Ian down, pinning him on his back. Mr. Hershel raised
      his gun once more, this time with a new urgency and rage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He brought
      the barrel level with Ian’s eyes. But at the same instant Ian stabbed his own
      gun up under Mr. Hershel’s chin and fired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was an abrupt,
      compacted explosion. A piece of Mr. Hershel’s skull leapt up into the air and
      landed wetly on Morgan’s bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Hershel slumped. Ian pushed
      the now limp body away, and it fell in a semi-sitting position against the desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      got on his feet and slid to Morgan’s side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’re okay,” he said.
      “You’re okay. Everything’s going to be okay now. Everything’s all over.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      stared blankly around the room, never quite meeting Ian’s eyes and looking too
      utterly confused and in too much pain to cry, or even to begin to try to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      pulled the comforter from her bed and wrapped it around her bloodied body. One
      of her eyes was almost swollen shut, and she was starting to shiver. He picked
      her up and carried her toward my car while I followed close behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      turned to me as he eased Morgan out the front door, careful not to let her head
      bump the doorframe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Can you get her some clothes?” he asked me.
      It was hard to comprehend such a practical request right now. “We’ll take her
      back to the house, but she’ll need some clothes.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yes,” I said.
      “Yes. I can”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hurried back through the house and stepped once
      again into Morgan’s room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Hershel’s body lay partly propped
      up with its back against the writing desk. I tried not to look at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      I couldn’t help it. I especially couldn’t help but notice Mr. Hershel's penis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was still strangely erect. It hadn’t subsided at all. Not throughout the entire
      fight with Ian, and not even after he’d been shot in the head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And
      his testicles, I noticed only now, were swollen and blackened, just like the
      corpse in the locker room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His head was pitched forward over one
      shoulder. I tried not to look at the gaping wound. I didn’t think I could handle
      actually seeing the brain matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it wasn’t exactly brain
      matter that I glimpsed inside his shattered skull. Just when I was about to
      force myself to look away, I saw . . . movement. There was something happening—some
      kind of slow <i>churning</i>—inside Mr. Hershel's head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took
      half a step closer. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the skull cavity was a mass of larvae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hundreds,
      thousands, maybe more, were spinning and twisting around in a thick bunch. Each
      larva was pale white, almost translucent, and about the width of a fingernail.
      A few had started to spill out of the gunshot wound, plinking down onto the
      blood-soaked carpet and writhing there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ian!” I called. I tried
      to take a breath, but I couldn’t breathe. “Ian!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I realized I
      wasn’t calling out at all, but whispering. I couldn’t speak. Another pair of
      larvae fell from Mr. Hershel’s head and landed softly on the carpet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      turned away from the body. I closed my eyes and forced myself to breathe. I
      just had to get Morgan’s clothes, and then I could leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I jerked
      open all of her drawers. I grabbed a few pairs of underwear, socks, and the
      first tops I could find. All she needed was something to cover up with; it didn’t
      matter what. As soon as I found a couple pairs of jeans, I wrapped everything
      up in an oversized t-shirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan’s phone was on the dresser,
      so I grabbed that too and left the room as quickly as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just
      as I stepped out onto the porch, the phone rang in my hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Ashley</i>
      flashed on the screen. Someone was calling from <i>my</i> phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Who
      is this?” I snapped, in an irrational mixture of overflowing confusion and fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Whoa!”
      said a male voice. “Everything okay? Is this Morgan?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Who <i>is</i>
      this?” I repeated. “This is Ashley. You have my phone.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s
      Bryce. Ashley, it’s Bryce. I ended up grabbing your phone after last night.
      I’m so sorry, it’s the same model as mine. I wanted to get it back to you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was approaching my car now, but I stopped short at the front gate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even
      after everything I’d just witnessed, what I saw now was even more surprising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      had no idea what to think. I dropped the phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my car’s front
      seat, dimly lit by the overhead light, Ian was holding Morgan tightly in the
      comforter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she had placed both of her hands, gently, at either
      side of his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And she was kissing him.</p>\r\n</div>"

    - "<div class=\"blog_text\"><p>I can’t believe I actually finished writing Part
      2 before the weekend! I had to stay up all night to do it, but I finished way
      ahead of schedule. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a few of you actually messaged my twitter
      account this week! I REALLY want to thank everyone so much who’s written to
      me with all the encouragement. It means a lot to me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually
      have to say how all this happened, this time. Because it was kind of crazy.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, my dad—he’s like, really strict—found out that I’d stayed
      up all night finishing Part 2. Or, he sort of found out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His rule
      is “lights out” at 10:30pm. I’d turned my bedroom light off by then, but I ended
      up staying up much later than I’d planned writing in bed on my laptop. I really
      wanted to finish a draft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad always gets up for work at 4:30,
      and I didn’t even realize how late it had gotten. He must have heard me typing
      or something, because he knew right away that I’d been up on my computer all
      night. He doesn’t let me have a lock on my door, so he can just open it. When
      he looked in, I didn’t have time to close my laptop or pull my covers over my
      head. But I’m really lucky that I always keep my Facebook page up, and at least
      I had time to open my web browser as fast as I could before he looked at my
      screen and saw what I was really working on. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad doesn’t really
      know what Facebook is, or how it works. I kind of lied and suggested I’d been
      on Facebook all night. He got all pissed, and he gave me this lecture about
      how important it is for me to get sleep, and how me and all my friends are addicted
      to the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, for my “punishment,” he turned off our internet
      connection. I know it’s stupid, and it doesn’t really make sense, but that’s
      what he did, because I “need to know that there are consequences” if I “choose
      to stay up all night on Facebook.” Blaaghh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, luckily, Kyle
      totally saved me. (“Kyle” isn’t really his name, just like “Bailey Simms” isn’t
      my real name, but I kind of have to keep all of this private so I don’t get
      caught.) He’s this really sweet guy in the class ahead of me. He’s not exactly
      my boyfriend, just this really nice, really good guy who I sort of grew up with.
      Ever since I’ve had to stay home from school for my treatments, he’s been like
      my best friend, even if we mostly just talk on the phone and text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway,
      his parents just got him an iPad, and it has this Hotspot thing where you can
      use an iPad as a Wi-Fi router. I told him my dad turned off our internet, but
      I didn’t tell him what I needed it for. (I haven’t told a single person that
      I’ve started this blog.) I only told him that I had a bunch of Facebook messages
      to respond to, which I did, but really I mostly wanted to post the next part
      of my novel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He’s so sweet, he didn’t even ask any questions.
      He just drove up to my house and parked his car across the street. He knew he
      wouldn’t be able to see me. He just called me from his car and told me he would
      sit there with his iPad Hotspot turned on as long as I needed to use the Wi-Fi,
      then he gave me the password. I never expected he would do anything like that.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, “Kyle.” You’re really
      the best. I honestly don’t know what I’d do without you. It’s honestly the best
      part of my day when you call me. I know you can’t read this because I haven’t
      told you about this novel yet. But without you, I wouldn’t have been able to
      publish this installment at all. So this one’s for you. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>. . .
      Okay, I better hurry up and post this so he doesn’t have to sit out there forever
      waiting for my slow ass to finish using his Hotspot. As always, thanks for reading!
      I’m @BaileySimms. Tweet me! I’m actually kinda nice! </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">xxBailey</p>\r\n</div>"

    - "<div class=\"novel_text\"><p><span class=\"first_letter\">I</span> held my
      hand up in front of my face. I moved my fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t see
      anything at all. Nothing. I couldn’t detect the slightest hint of movement.
      The darkness surrounding me was perfectly complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to
      keep my breathing under control. The faster I breathed, the more oxygen I used
      up, and the less time I would have to live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s what I’d <i>heard</i>
      about being buried alive, anyway. I didn’t see why it wouldn’t be true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not
      that it really mattered whether I’d have just a few minutes to live or an hour.
      One way or another, this was it. I tried hard to accept the fact that I was
      going to die soon, that my life was going to end, that I was already beginning
      to suffocate. But it just didn’t seem like it could be real, no matter how hard
      it was getting to breathe the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I reached out and touched the
      rough wood only a few inches in front of my face. I could feel its raw, grainy
      texture. The scent of freshly-cut pine was overwhelming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
      was real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was a kid I used to think that the most horrifying
      way to die would be to be buried alive. Worse than drowning, worse than getting
      killed in a car accident, worse even than being burned to death. The pain of
      burning would be unimaginably excruciating, I knew. But the horror wouldn’t
      quite compare to suffocating inside a narrow, hot box beneath six feet of heavy
      dirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I even used to promise myself that I’d never get close to
      a coffin as long as I lived. Inviting even the remote possibility of ending
      up trapped inside one seemed like a stupid risk to take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet
      somehow here I was. I’d let it happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt around for my cell
      phone and clicked it on. The screen’s dim light glared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The battery
      was now almost completely dead. I’d lost count of how many times I’d tried checking
      my phone for a signal. Nothing had changed; there was no service this far under
      ground, and there wasn’t ever going to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I clicked off the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once
      again I was lost in darkness.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>t
      all started two days earlier when Morgan fell into a coma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don’t
      know if it was because her mind just shut down from the trauma of being attacked
      by Mr. Hershel, or if it was because of some other reason which I didn’t fully
      understand. But right after I saw her curled up in Ian’s lap in my car, his
      arms holding her tightly and their lips somehow pressed together, Morgan convulsed
      briefly, then she collapsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian tried to wake her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Morgan?”
      He shook her, and when she didn’t wake he lightly slapped her face. “Morgan?
      Sweetheart, you need to stay with me! Morgan!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she wouldn’t
      wake up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I threw the spare clothes I’d grabbed into the back and
      squeezed beside Morgan, who was now lying slumped and unmoving in the passenger
      seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian raced us back to my parents’ house. All the way there
      I did my best to keep talking to Morgan and calling her name into her ear, like
      Ian told me to do. But every time I gave her another series of brisk slaps,
      my best friend’s head only rolled back down against her shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      the middle of all this, Ian tried to explain what I’d just seen going on between
      them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t know what happened,” he said. “I don’t understand.
      I was trying to comfort her and suddenly her hands were all over me. And then
      she was kissing me. After everything she just went through.” He shook his head
      emphatically. “I don’t know why she would do something like that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything
      about Ian’s tone should have told me that he was telling the truth that Morgan
      had just started pressing her body against his and kissing him, out of the blue.
      But now, honestly, I couldn’t be totally sure. The Ian I knew was an extremely
      honest person, but that didn’t mean he was incapable of lying to me. I wasn’t
      naïve. After Morgan had told me at the fair that she was cheating on Jason with
      someone she couldn’t name, and after I’d found Ian’s hoodie and gun in my car
      where Morgan had slept, and after I’d just watched the way she’d been kissing
      him, I couldn’t shake the idea that Morgan and Ian had been secretly sleeping
      together before all of this had started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, I tried not
      think about it. Somehow I’d find out the truth later, but not now. More than
      anything else I was terrified that Morgan might die. She still wasn’t waking
      up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we reached my parents’ house, Ian carried Morgan upstairs
      to my old bedroom. I pulled back the covers and helped Ian lay her limp body
      in my childhood bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the blood that had spread from her
      face to her pubic hair was now dry and hardened. I ran downstairs to get a mixing
      bowl to use as a washbasin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What on earth is going on?” my mom
      called out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s Morgan,” I said as I hurried by the living room.
      “She’s hurt. Ian’s taking care of her.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I grabbed a washcloth
      and filled the mixing bowl with soap and warm water. I could tell my mom was
      totally confused about everything that was happening. She didn’t ask any more
      questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Ian kept watch of Morgan’s pulse and the rate
      of her breathing, I did my best to clean the blood from her body. I washed her
      face, her breasts, her tummy, then I began gingerly cleaning her pubic hair
      and around her vagina, part of which had actually been torn a little and had
      been a source of some of the bleeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh Morgan,” I whispered,
      but I had no hope that she was able to hear me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost as soon
      as I'd begun cleaning the blood off her tangled pubic hair, Morgan began to
      whimper. But she was obviously still deeply unconscious. It was almost like
      she was dreaming. The sound that came from her throat, though, was definitely
      not one of pain or fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somehow, it was one of <i>pleasure</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still
      totally unconscious, she began grinding her pelvis, pressing against the washcloth
      and my hand as I did my best to clean the blood from between the folds of her
      vagina without hurting her. The whimpering started to grow into rhythmic moans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Morgan,
      sweetie,” I whispered. “What are you doing? Stay still, sweetie. Please wake
      up. Wake up.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian touched my arm. Morgan was as cleaned up as
      she was going to be without putting her in a bath. I pulled the warm washcloth
      away from between her legs. Right away her moaning subsided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What
      the hell <i>is</i> this?” Ian took Morgan’s pulse once again. “Her heart’s racing,”
      he said. “She’s also burning up.\" He gave me a confused, desperate stare. \"I’ve
      never seen anything like this.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together we dressed her in sweatpants
      and a t-shirt, then covered her with the sheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We have to take
      her to the hospital.” I looked at Ian. He was standing over Morgan, folding
      his arms, staring at her, not meeting my eye. “Right?” I said. “We have to take
      her to the hospital.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan lay almost totally still now. Other
      than her swollen eyebrow, she appeared to be sleeping more or less restfully.
      Ian placed his hand on her hot forehead, yet again. It was like he was trying
      to solve a puzzle, but missing some essential piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The hospital
      isn’t a good idea,” he said. It was almost as though he was talking to himself.
      “Not now. I don’t know how safe it is there.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remembered what
      Ian had said about the armed guards surrounding the room of the girl who had
      been attacked at the fair. He’d told me they wouldn’t even let the parents in
      to see their daughter. Now that Morgan had been attacked too, would they do
      the same to her at the hospital? Would they take her away and lock her in some
      medical facility to run who knew what kind of tests? Or worse?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Okay,”
      I said. “I understand.” Or I thought I understood. I tried to trust Ian’s instincts.
      “We’ll keep her here.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No one can know where she is.” Ian gave
      me a look that told me just how important this was. He was dead serious. “No
      one,” he repeated. “This is the safest place for her. But you have to tell your
      family not to tell a soul she’s here. You don’t have to say why. They trust
      you. Tell them that someone had burgled Morgan’s house, beat her up, then killed
      Mr. Hershel when he came to try to protect her. That’s the story.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      nodded again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian rubbed his eyes. He looked totally exhausted.
      And scared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Stay here with Morgan,” he said. “Give me a call
      from the land line if she wakes up or if anything changes. I have to go take
      care of Mr. Hershel.” </p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">O</span>nly
      a minute or two after I heard Ian’s SUV pull out of the driveway, someone knocked
      on the bedroom door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Shawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I could
      stand up from the bed, my husband had already opened the door and stepped inside
      the room. He’d been sleeping on the couch, and he was in the sweats and t-shirt
      he used as pajamas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What is going <i>on</i>?” He was furious.
      “You have to tell me what’s going on!” He stepped directly in front of me as
      if trying to block me from running away. “Tell me now.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I put
      my hands on his chest as calmly as possible and gently pushed him a step back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just...”
      I began, trying to figure out what to say and how to keep him in a reasonable
      state of mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is when Shawn finally glanced at Morgan. Her
      right eye was now completely swollen shut. Her breathing was regular, but now
      her breaths were coming a little more quickly than normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh
      God,” he mumbled, turning away. “Ashley, what the <i>fuck</i> is going on?”
      He was no less upset, but now at least he was whispering and speaking a little
      more pleadingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“She was raped,” I whispered tentatively. “And
      beaten.” I lowered my voice even further. “She won’t <i>wake up</i>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      hoped this information would give my husband a sense of perspective. I hoped
      it would make him feel a little compassion for Morgan. But it only had the opposite
      effect. Years ago Shawn never would have acted like this. But ever since his
      mill accident something had changed. I don’t know what exactly, but he was more
      fearful. And after everything that had happened over the last twenty-four hours,
      his fearfulness was coming out in ways that were starting to frighten me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Didn’t
      I tell you it wasn’t a good idea to keep hanging out with fucking Morgan?” he
      snapped. “What if this was you? On this bed?” Indignantly, he added, “And why
      did you bring her <i>here</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Because Ian thinks it’s safest
      here,” I said, gathering myself. “There’s a lot of shit going on, Shawn, that
      nobody understands.” I told him the story that Ian had given me about a burglar
      who had broken into Morgan’s house and killed Mr. Hershel. “That’s it,\" I said.
      \"That’s all I know. That’s all anyone knows.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Mr. <i>Hershel</i>?”
      Shawn looked at me like I was crazy. “Mr. Hershel’s dead? Ashley, what are you
      <i>talking</i> about? Mr. Hershel? He isn’t dead.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as my husband
      spoke I could tell it was starting to sink in that I was telling the truth about
      Mr. Hershel. He was starting to see that things were going bizarrely wrong.
      His eyes were beginning to tear up. I could tell he was struggling not to cry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      don’t give a fuck about Mr. Hershel!” he burst out. I didn’t expect this. “All
      I care about is what’s been going on with you! and where you’ve been! And who
      the fuck you’ve been <i>with</i>. You were gone <i>all night</i>. You’ve been
      gone for hours all fucking day. I’ve been worrying my fucking ass off! Tell
      me <i>what the fuck is going on!</i>”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sat down on the bed beside
      Morgan. For some reason I felt safer being close to her. Shawn had never hurt
      me, but for the first time I was afraid that he might try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ll
      tell you everything in the morning,” I whispered. “It’s not what you think.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      said this, but I had no idea of this was true or not. Maybe what had happened
      was more or less exactly what Shawn thought had happened. The problem was that
      <i>I</i> still didn’t even know exactly what had happened. I tried to keep focused
      on Morgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Right now, Morgan needs help,” I said. “A lot of help.
      She’s in trouble. She’s hurt bad. She’s not even fucking <i>conscious</i>, Shawn.
      Do you understand? She may be in a coma for all I know. And I think she’s getting
      worse.” My voice started to crack. I took a breath and forced myself not to
      break down as long as Shawn was in the room. “And there’s nothing <i>you</i>
      can do to help! Is there?” I snapped. “Right now, you’re only in the fucking
      way.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could tell this stung. But I wanted it to sting. Shawn
      gave me a hurt look I’d never seen before. His face darkened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      clenched both of his fists, and stepped toward me, putting his face right next
      to mine. He was breathing hard. He was furious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He lifted his
      right fist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t take my eyes from his. I forced myself not
      to look away. If he was going to hit me, he was going to hit me, and there was
      nothing I could do about it. Instinctively I grasped for Morgan’s limp arm and
      held it tightly. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn sobbed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn't hit me;
      he stepped away, and a huge tear slipped down his cheek. He just shook his head
      back and forth, still furious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He knew I'd betrayed him. And it
      was true. However badly he'd been acting lately, I had betrayed him. I thought
      about the old Shawn, and how we used to be together when we were younger, and
      I felt sick. Then I thought about the old me, and how somehow I'd changed. Whatever
      I'd done last night, I'd done it. And right now, I couldn't afford to let myself
      feel sick about anything, even if I deserved to. All that mattered right now
      was keeping Morgan alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn turned and stepped out of the
      room. He gave me one last indignant look over his shoulder, then he closed the
      door, surprisingly gently, and went back downstairs to sleep on my parents'
      couch.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span> must
      have slept, because sometime before dawn I woke sitting up on my old desk chair.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian had returned sometime during the night. He was sleeping on
      the floor, pillowless, his folded hands beneath his cheek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd
      awoken because I could hear someone pulling into the driveway. What sounded
      like a large vehicle moved over the gravel, then it came to a stop outside the
      window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian woke, leapt up, and looked between the closed blinds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fuck,”
      he whispered. \"Stay here.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He left, hurrying downstairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone
      had started knocking loudly on the front door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Ian Craig? Shawn
      Young?\" The gruff, official voice that called out paused long enough knock
      loudly three more times. \"Are Ian Craig and Shawn Young on these premises?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      peered between the blinds. Some kind of large, black military SUV was idling
      in the driveway. Three men in uniform stood beside it. I couldn't tell what
      kind of uniforms they were, but they definitely weren't local or even state
      police. The men looked more like soldiers at war. They were dressed in full
      combat gear. Each held an automatic weapon pointed at the ground. They must
      have been some kind of military police. They waited without expression while
      the fourth man, the one in charge and who I couldn't see, called out to Ian
      and Shawn at the front door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I'd heard Ian's name, I wasn't
      totally surprised, even if I had no idea who these people were or what they
      wanted from him. But when they called out for my husband, too, I wasn't ready
      to hear his name in the same breath. What could they want with Shawn? I didn't
      understand how anybody could possibly know that Shawn and Ian were at my parents'
      house. Neither my husband nor my brother-in-law had addresses registered here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      heard Ian open the door, then his startled voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"What is this?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was hard to make out what the man who’d been knocking said in response, but
      there was something about “emergency conscription orders.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard
      Ian say, “No one’s leaving this house.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sir, you have one option
      and one option only. One way or another you’re coming with us. Time is extremely
      sensitive. You’ll be debriefed at the center. Here are your orders.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn
      must have arrived at the door while the man in charge was handing over whatever
      conscription documentation he had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shawn Young?” he asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m
      Shawn Young. What’s—”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“These are your conscription orders, son.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After
      a pause, Ian said, “We’re not even wearing shoes. What is this?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      have exactly thirty seconds to get what you need. Otherwise, appropriate footwear
      will be provided at the center. I will not repeat again that time is extremely
      sensitive.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this, the three armed men who'd been standing back
      actually raised their guns. Practically in unison, they took a few steps forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’ve
      got to me fucking kidding me,” Ian said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I assure you I am not.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      was some shuffling in the entryway while Ian and Shawn must have been putting
      on their shoes and jackets. The uniformed men who had drawn their weapons didn’t
      move. They kept their guns trained directly at the front door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Our
      wives are inside,” Ian said. “My kids. We need to tell them we’re leaving. At
      least.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The armed men stepped forward, marching up the front steps
      and onto the porch. They moved out of my line of sight. All I could see now
      was the idling SUV with its faint trail of exhaust visible in the coolness of
      the morning air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sir, even the very fact of your leaving these
      premises has to be kept under the utmost secrecy. Do I make myself clear?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly
      I saw Ian stumbling down the porch. Two of the armed guards were holding his
      shoulders. Right behind them came Shawn. He was being escorted toward the SUV
      in the same way, a guard at each arm. It looked like they were being arrested.
      Ian was in the faded blue jeans he’d been sleeping in, and Shawn was still in
      his sweats. His tennis shoes were untied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The guards threw Ian
      and Shawn into the large SUV and climbed in behind them without lowering their
      guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I gave Morgan a quick glance. It was the first time I’d
      looked at her that morning. She was breathing faster than she’d been the night
      before. I put my hand on her forehead. She was still burning up. But she was
      still alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Be right back, sweetie,” I whispered, knowing full
      well she couldn’t hear me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I raced down the stairs. Haley had
      been using her coloring books at the base of the stairway, and I had to be careful
      not to slip on the crayons she’d left scattered everywhere. I opened the front
      door and ran out onto the porch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The black SUV was already speeding
      away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stumbled onto the driveway in my socks. For a moment I
      considered following after it in my car, but that was obviously a stupid idea.
      There was nothing I could do. I looked back at my parents’ old farmhouse. Already
      I was worried about leaving Morgan alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went back inside.
      In the entryway, I noticed that there was something stuffed into the pocket
      of the jacket I’d left hanging on the rack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was an envelope,
      partly crumpled. An unopened credit card offer. I turned the envelope over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On
      the back was Ian’s handwriting in purple crayon. He must have taken the envelope
      from the mail piled in the entryway while putting on his shoes. He’d managed
      to use one of Haley’s scattered crayons to scribble out a message:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>DO
      NOT LET ANYONE </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>TAKE MORGAN AWAY</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found
      my sister’s jacket and rifled through its pockets. Another note, this one written
      over a post office pink slip, said only:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>AM SAFE </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>DON’T
      WORRY </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>LOVE IAN</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How could he possibly
      know that he would be safe? After what I’d overheard that morning, there didn’t
      seem to be any reason to believe I’d see Ian or Shawn any time soon. Or maybe
      ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fact swept over me slowly as I dialed Shawn’s number
      on my parent’s old rotary phone in the entryway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No answer. His
      phone was off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried Ian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No answer on Ian’s phone
      either. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their phones had probably been confiscated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      house was silent. My parents’ bedroom and Danielle’s bedroom, where she was
      sleeping with both her kids, were both in the back of the house. They’d slept
      through everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t wake them. Before anything else I
      had to figure out what to do with Morgan. I’d barely glanced at her before racing
      out of the bedroom, but it was clear enough that she hadn’t gotten any better
      during the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I was pretty sure, now, that Morgan wasn’t
      safe here at the house anymore. If someone was trying to find her—and Ian seemed
      to think that someone probably was—it wouldn’t be long before they came looking
      for her here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I had to keep her safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">T</span>ouching Morgan’s forehead was like
      touching a hot water bottle freshly filled with boiling water. Her breathing
      was so fast now that it seemed almost like a dog’s panting. She was taking in
      short little breaths and releasing them maybe two times a second. She was sweating.
      Beads of perspiration had collected on her upper lip and across her cheeks.
      I was too afraid to take her temperature and find out how high it actually was.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to figure out where to move her, and how. But before anything
      else I had to get her some water. Considering how much she’d been sweating,
      I figured she was probably nearly dehydrated. There was a glass at the bedside
      table, which I took into the bathroom to fill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On my way back
      through the hallway, I could hear my mom stirring downstairs. She was in the
      kitchen, cooking. Bacon and eggs, it smelled like. She was probably trying to
      create some small, homey comfort to lift everyone’s spirits after everything
      that had been going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she didn’t know the half of it. She
      didn’t know that Ian and Shawn had been taken away, not yet. I was pretty sure
      she had no idea that Mr. Hershel was dead. I didn’t think she even realized
      that Morgan was still in the house, not at the hospital, and maybe dying in
      my childhood bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Briefly I envied my mom. I didn’t think that
      I’d ever be able to just get up one morning and do something as simple and pleasant
      as cooking eggs, not ever again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I slipped back into my room,
      eased the door shut, and tipped the water into Morgan’s mouth. She was breathing
      so quickly that most of the water just spilled down her cheeks. I didn’t know
      if she’d even swallowed any at all. I tried tipping a few drops at a time between
      her lips while I figured out how to hide her in a safer place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly,
      for the second time this morning, I heard someone knocking at the front door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      hadn’t even heard anyone drive up this time. I was too focused on Morgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through
      the blinds I saw a black sedan parked in the driveway. Its windows were heavily
      tinted. There was no way I could see if there was anyone else inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another
      knock came at the front door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time it was my dad who answered.
      There was another male voice which I couldn’t make out. But I heard my dad say,
      “Oh, yes. Yes. She’s upstairs. She’s awake. I just heard her up. It’s the first
      room on the left.” He called out, “Ashley, someone’s here to see you! He’s coming
      up!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d never been so frustrated with my father’s unquestioning
      trustfulness and his idiotic country hospitality. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why hadn’t
      I tried to hide Morgan faster? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d wasted too much time not deciding
      quickly enough what to do, and now someone was already here. Ian had a hunch
      that someone would come for Morgan, but I didn’t think even he knew how fast
      they would arrive. Now it was too late. If someone was here looking for me,
      then it must have been Morgan who they were really trying to find. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Footsteps
      came up the stairs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I dropped to my knees and looked under the
      bed. The space was mostly filled with plastic bins filled with my old clothes
      and school papers. It was too shallow anyway. I could never fit Morgan under
      there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I threw open my closet door. It was filled with hanging
      clothes and shoes, but there was probably just enough room for Morgan on the
      floor if I bent her legs and closed the door. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would have to
      do. I had no other choice. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled back the sheets, slipped
      my arms beneath her body, and lifted her from the bed. She felt incredibly fragile,
      but she was heavier than I thought she’d be. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of her legs
      slipped from my grasp. I had to set her on the floor before I made it all the
      way to the closet. Her head bumped hard against the carpet. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fuck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She
      started breathing even faster. She was still sweating, and she’d grown pale.
      She started to make little rasping coughs. A thin foam had appeared at the corners
      of her mouth. I was terrified that she was on the verge of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      was a soft knock on the bedroom door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I grabbed the chair and
      wedged it under the doorknob as quietly as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I lifted
      Morgan’s ankles. I had no choice but to drag her the last few feet to the closet.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was another knock at the door. Now whoever it was quietly
      said my name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley?” Another soft knock. “It’s me. Are you
      there?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recognized the smooth voice of a professional singer.
      I knew right away who it was. Bryce Tripp was in my parents’ house. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      practically collapsed in relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I have your phone,” he said
      through the door. “I hope I’m not bothering you. Sorry for showing up so early.”
      He was playing it cool, but I could tell he was shaken by everything that was
      going on in town. He must have been stuck in Muldoon since the roadblocks went
      up. “I hope it’s okay,” he said. “Your dad said I should just come up.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      set Morgan’s legs back onto the floor, moved the chair from the door, and opened
      it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right away Bryce saw Morgan on the floor. “What the hell?”
      He knelt beside her. “What happened? Is she okay?” He gave her swollen eye a
      closer look. “Oh my God. She’s not okay.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I can’t explain,” I
      said. “Not now. But I need help. Will you help me? Please.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yes,”
      he said. “Sure. What? Anything.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just don’t ask any questions.
      I’ll try to explain later. I have to get her someplace safe. She’s not safe
      here. I can’t carry her on my own.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Whatever you say.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      gathered Morgan’s limp body into his arms and lifted her. He was taller even
      than Ian, and he picked her up like she weighed no more than a pillow. He was
      wearing only a t-shirt and jeans, and when he stood cradling Morgan, the muscles
      in his arms tightened. He probably had to keep in such good shape for his stage
      presence and his album covers, but now all of his working out was paying off
      in a much more practical way. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he looked at me with his icy
      blue eyes, casually waiting to do whatever I told him to do, the same wave of
      physical attraction I’d felt when I first spoke to him at the concert passed
      over me again. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt so guilty. Morgan was on the verge of death,
      and yet I was undeniably, if very strangely, turned on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Follow
      me,” I said. “We have to get her out of the house.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I made sure
      no one was coming up the stairs or standing on the landing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hurry,”
      I said. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I led Bryce quickly down the stairs and outside. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like
      just about every other farmhouse in Colorado, my parents’ house is on a lot
      surrounded by pole barns, grain silos, and farming equipment. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      looked quickly at these options and settled on the old wooden building my dad
      just called “the shop.” It was where he worked on his swathers and bailers whenever
      they broke down, and it had a lofted storage area whose key he kept hidden under
      an old tin drum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This way,” I said to Bryce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      trotted the fifty yards or so to the shop. I opened the large double doors,
      found the key to the storage area, and opened the lock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom
      level had only a dirt floor. Old engine parts, an abandoned deep freezer, and
      retired, dried-out saddles cluttered the space. Everything was covered in dust.
      Long shafts of light shined in through the cracks between the wallboards. A
      couple of pigeons flew out through a hole in the corrugated tin roof. Otherwise,
      everything was totally silent except for the sound of Morgan’s quick, labored
      breathing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I grabbed an old saddle blanket and shook it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This
      way,” I said. Bryce followed me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very narrow, very steep, very
      worn-out wooden stairway led up to the hayloft. As Bryce followed me, carrying
      Morgan’s weight, the wooden planks creaked. One even cracked a little, but the
      stairway held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hayloft hadn’t been used for years, but there
      was still loose hay scattered all over the floor. If I had to, I could cover
      Morgan with hay and hide her that way. It was the best idea I could think of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      kicked some of the loose hay aside and laid out the saddle blanket in the loft’s
      farthest corner. Bryce lay Morgan on it. He felt her forehead. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“She’s
      really burning up.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was panting even faster. And now there
      was a new rasping sound coming from deep inside her lungs. It sounded like she
      was struggling just to pull in air. Her hair was so wet with perspiration and
      slicked against her scalp it looked she’d just been doused with water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      gave me an uneasy glance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe it didn’t even matter where we
      hid Morgan. It was hard to imagine that she could stay alive much longer in
      this state. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t want to think about her dying. But I was
      terrified that she would. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to prepare myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">B</span>ryce stayed with me at Morgan’s side
      all morning. He pulled his car behind the barn where it wasn’t visible from
      the house or the driveway, and he sat with me in the loose hay. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      didn’t want him to leave. I was scared of taking care of Morgan all alone. I
      was also scared of being stuck with nothing else to do but worry about Ian and
      Shawn. But I didn’t want to push my luck and hope for too much from Bryce. He
      hardly knew me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My family’s going to start worrying about me,”
      I said. “I’d better go check in with them. They don’t really know what’s going
      on.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce nodded. “I’ll stay here and keep an eye on her while
      you’re gone. I don’t mind.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You sure you don’t mind? You don’t
      even know her. You don’t need to stay. Really. I’m sure you want to get out
      of here. You’ve done so much already.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shrugged and smiled
      shyly. “What else am I going to do while I’m stuck in Muldoon?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      thanked him again and told him I’d be back in fifteen minutes. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">A</span>t the house everything had changed.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bacon lay cold and half-cooked on the stove. My Mom sat with
      Danielle and the kids at the kitchen table. They’d given up on breakfast. They’d
      obviously learned that Ian and Shawn were missing. Danielle was holding her
      crayon-scrawled note from Ian. My dad was on the phone. Ian must have told him
      the night before that Mr. Hershel had died, because he was busying himself by
      planning a funeral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Tomorrow morning,” he was saying somberly
      into the phone. “Yes. At their place. Make it if you can, Connie. We all understand.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone
      glared at me like I was some kind of traitor when I stepped into the kitchen.
      Once again, I’d returned from an inexplicable absence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley,
      what is going <i>on</i>?” My mom demanded, standing as soon as she saw me. “Where
      have you <i>been</i>? Please, please tell me you know where Ian and Shawn are.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      told them everything I’d seen and heard that morning. I described the dark SUV
      and the military police who took Ian and Shawn away. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad put
      down the phone. Danielle began crying hysterically. Tyler tried to comfort her,
      while Haley just stayed curled up in a little ball on a kitchen chair. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Where
      have you <i>been</i>?” my mom asked again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve been out looking
      for Shawn,” I lied. “With a friend of his,” I added, remembering that my dad
      had seen Bryce that morning. I decided that the best way to keep my family from
      telling anyone about Morgan was not to tell them that she was even still here
      on the property. “I’m going back to the house to lock up. I just have to have
      something to eat first.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Are you sure about that, Ashley?” My
      dad was concerned. “You be damn careful.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I nodded. “I will.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There’s
      a service for Mr. Hershel tomorrow morning. I’d like you to be there.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sure.”
      I nodded again. “Okay, I will.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hadn’t eaten anything for a
      day and a half. I was starving. Despite Morgan, and despite Ian and Shawn’s
      disappearance, I had a strange, intense craving for a hamburger and a milkshake.
      I couldn’t get these things off my mind, and yet it was hard to imagine ever
      having a chance to eat a hamburger again. It already seemed like some exotic,
      foreign meal. Instead, I had to make do with a roast beef sandwich and a glass
      of milk. I piled the meat high and skipped the mustard. I made a second sandwich
      and packed it into a plastic bag for Bryce. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On my way out I parked
      my car next to Bryce’s behind the barn where it was hidden from view. I made
      sure no one was watching when I opened the shop doors. I closed them behind
      me and climbed back up into the hayloft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How is she?” I asked
      Bryce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Maybe a little better,” he said. “I think. Just a little.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan’s
      breathing was still coming in quick rasps, and she was still running an extremely
      high fever. But it did seem like maybe her breathing had regulated a little.
      It was hard to tell in the dim light, but maybe some of her color had even come
      back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s hard to explain how happy this made me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Brought
      you a sandwich.” I handed the plastic bag to Bryce. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was sitting
      cross-legged, keeping a close eye on Morgan even while he began to eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      said, “So I have to confess something.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yeah?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      don’t remember anything about what happened Friday night. Nothing. I drank way
      too much. Everything after the bar is totally blacked out.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      smiled sheepishly. “<i>I</i> remember. You really don’t remember any of it?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      shook my head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That’s a shame.” He smiled again, but more wryly
      this time. “So are you asking me to tell you?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt myself blush
      a little. I turned away. “I wouldn’t mind.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well I guess I could
      give you a recap.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I was with you?” I asked, lamely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      laughed. “Yeah. You were with me. You really don’t remember?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      shook my head. “I was with you the whole night?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Most of it.”
      Bryce shrugged and smiled once again. He really was incredibly attractive, especially
      when he smiled. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I glanced at Morgan. I couldn’t believe I was
      having this conversation right now. But I had to know what had happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Okay,
      so tell me,” I said. “After the bar. What happened?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce cleared
      his throat. “Well. After the bar. Let’s see. You and I went out for a smoke.
      And we kinda decided not to go back in. . . We thought maybe the motel would
      be a better idea.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I know this is a stupid question,” I said.
      “But we—well… we . . . slept together?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before he answered, Bryce
      gave me this long, cute shrug. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well. All I can say is that it’s
      a shame you don’t remember.” He nodded, obviously remembering back to the night
      I couldn’t recall. I was jealous that he could remember it and I couldn’t. “It
      wasn’t bad,” he said. Then he whispered, “Honestly you were kind of amazing.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      felt dizzy. I felt like I’d turned into butter. It was all I could do not to
      throw myself at him right there on the loft, even while Morgan struggled to
      breathe. I’d felt the warmth of Bryce’s breath on my ear when he’d leaned over
      and whispered that he thought it was amazing sleeping with me. However guilty
      I felt for cheating on Shawn, I felt robbed that I couldn’t remember my night
      with Bryce. I forced myself to suppress this new surge of attraction. I couldn’t
      believe how strong it was. What was wrong with me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I turned away
      and forced myself to focus solely on Morgan. I checked her pulse. I was starting
      to worry that her breathing hadn’t actually slowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And then
      what?” I asked Bryce pragmatically. “I woke up alone. Without my cell phone!”
      I slapped his arm. “Where’d you go?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yeah, sorry about the phone,”
      he said. “I got out of there when your husband showed up.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My
      husband?” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was he talking about?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve learned
      the hard way that if a guy from the military shows up when you’re in bed with
      his wife, it’s better not to stick around.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Wait,” I said. “What
      do you mean the military?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, it said <i>Army</i> on his sweatshirt
      and he had a big fucking gun. I kind of put two and two together and crawled
      out the back window.” He added sheepishly, “That part I’m glad you don’t remember.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shit!”
      I whispered. “Ian was there?” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So all this time Ian knew I’d cheated
      on Shawn. He’d just been too gracious to say anything. I couldn’t believe it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That
      wasn’t my husband,” I explained. “He’s my brother-in-law. Didn’t I say so when
      I introduced him at the bar?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Nope.” Bryce shook his head. “I
      guess all you said was that your husband was in the bar somewhere. I just assumed
      it was him. That guy really wasn’t your husband? He sure was looking at you
      like he was.” Bryce laughed, amused. “And he sure did come after you like he
      was, too. But I admit I didn’t exactly stick around long enough to confirm one
      way or the other.”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>t
      had been a mistake to hope that Morgan was improving. By noon she was breathing
      much harder than ever before. Her whole body was starting to convulse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not
      only this, but now we couldn’t keep her hand from making its way down into her
      sweatpants. Bryce tried to hold both of her arms to her sides, but as soon as
      he let up a little, she just pulled away and started . . . <i>touching</i> herself
      and doing something that would have looked a lot like masturbation if she weren’t
      unconscious. It was bizarre, and terrifying. It was horrible. I didn’t know
      how to react to seeing my best friend this way. It was like Morgan had been
      replaced by somebody else. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d gotten so used to the sound of
      her quick, raspy breathing that when it stopped it was like the whole world
      died with her. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There wasn’t even the sound of pigeons tip-toeing
      on the tin roof. Everything was suddenly silent and still. Bryce just sat there
      staring at Morgan’s motionless body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remembered playing with
      Morgan on this very hayloft when we were kids. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We used to hollow
      out nests in the loose hay and call them our “houses” and pretend we were visiting
      each other and that we were grown up. We used to plan out who we’d marry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now,
      just like that, she was dead. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without my best friend, I felt
      numb. Not just numb to Morgan’s lying dead in the hay at my feet, but numb to
      everything. Numb to my family, numb to Bryce. Numb to myself. Suddenly I didn’t
      care if anyone lived or died. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then something happened which,
      at the time, I had no explanation for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan’s body was lying
      on its back, her head thrown back at an awkward angle. When she’d died, she’d
      frozen in that stiff position, her slender white neck exposed and her mouth
      tipped open. She’d been lying like that for ten or fifteen minutes while I’d
      just been sitting there, shocked, trying to comprehend what had happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      then, very, very gently, she moved. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As if she’d been simply sleeping
      peacefully, she stretched her shoulders. Then she slowly turned onto her side
      and rested her head on her hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What the—” Bryce turned to
      me, stunned, then he stared back at Morgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I placed a finger
      on her neck and took her pulse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“She’s <i>alive</i>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her
      pulse was strong and fluttering away normally. Her awful panting hadn’t returned.
      Now she took slow, even breaths and released them without any rasping sound
      at all. Even some of her color had come back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I collapsed on top
      of her and sobbed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Morgan,” I whispered. “I thought you left
      me. Don’t you ever fucking leave me again.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still couldn’t rouse
      Morgan to consciousness, but I was almost sure now that she was going to be
      okay. She suddenly looked extraordinarily healthy, almost angelic. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Jesus
      Christ,” Bryce whispered. “I’ve never, ever seen anything like that.” He shook
      his head in disbelief. “I’m no doctor, but maybe the fever just had to break?
      I thought she was gone.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So did I,” I whispered, holding Morgan’s
      hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I guess you just never know about things like this.” Bryce
      laughed softly, still amazed at what we’d witnessed. “A little while ago I was
      held up in the hospital overnight. They thought it was dysentery or something.
      I guess I had a bad chicken taco in El Paso. I was in bad shape. But I woke
      up feeling totally fine. They wanted to keep me there at the hospital, but I
      didn’t want to have to cancel my concert here in Muldoon. So I just walked out
      and left.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I laughed. “Remind me not to eat the tacos in El Paso.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was feeling elated. I hadn’t thought that I’d ever laugh again. A moment earlier
      I honestly wouldn’t have cared if I died, but now that Morgan was not only alive
      but getting better, I had a new hope that maybe things might turn out okay after
      all. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce was here with me too, and he didn’t seem to want to
      leave. I would have been happy just to sit here talking with him all day about
      anything other than whatever crazy shit was happening in Muldoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After
      a moment I let go of Morgan’s hand and sat back in the hay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So
      you never miss a concert, or what?” I asked Bryce, suddenly happy enough to
      make conversation while Morgan rested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shrugged and smiled.
      “Not if I can help it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How’d it all happen for you? You just
      loved country music so much you couldn’t stop playing it, and suddenly you were
      on tour?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He laughed. “Not exactly. Tell you the truth, I don’t
      really care for country.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Seriously</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My
      mom used to make me play it. She had me playing professionally by the time I
      was a teenager. Honestly, I’m kinda tired of it. I actually really like some
      of the indie stuff they’re doing lately.” He laughed. “Don’t tell anyone this,
      but who I really, really like is Lady Gaga. I can’t stop listening to her.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      couldn’t stop laughing. “Are you kidding?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And you know what
      else? You know what my real name is?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s not Bryce Tripp?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Nope.
      It’s Reggie Wislowski.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I laughed even harder at this. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Reggie?”</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      laughed too and tried to put his hand over my mouth while I swatted it back.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Don’t laugh!” he said. “I’ve gone by Bryce since I was a kid.”
      He sat back in the hay. “Don’t tell anyone my secret.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I won’t.”
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce glanced at Morgan again. She was sleeping peacefully, and
      still breathing strongly. Even the swelling around her eye had gone down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      guess you must really regret coming to do this concert here, after all, now,”
      I said. “Don’t you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment there was a distant look in
      Bryce’s blue eyes. But then he looked right at me and gave my shoulder a soft,
      playful push. “Not so far, I don’t.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t know what to say.
      For a moment I’d forgotten all about Mr. Hershel and Ian and Shawn. It really
      <i>was</i> a shame that I’d actually slept with this staggeringly attractive
      country singer who had a secret passion for Lady Gaga, but couldn’t remember
      a thing about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Thank you,” I said. “Really. Thank you so much
      for everything.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s nothing,” Bryce said. “Look. You need to
      get back to your folks tonight. Why don’t I stay here and look after Morgan?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      didn’t want to accept, but I didn’t want him to leave either. I wanted to get
      a good night’s sleep for once and wake up to find Bryce still waiting for me,
      watching over Morgan as she healed in the hayloft. And he was right. I did need
      to get back to my family. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You really don’t mind?” I asked him.
      “Really?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shrugged and smiled. “What else am I going to do
      with myself?”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">T</span>he
      next morning I woke up at dawn to the sound of a text message on my phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was from Bryce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>come quick!!!”</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I slipped
      out of my old bedroom, tiptoed down the stairs, and ran to the shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All
      the way there I thought about how at one point when I’d thought that Morgan
      was getting better, she’d only ended up getting worse. What if this time too
      she’d slipped back into that awful, feverish state of labored breathing? What
      if this time she really had died?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ran up the rickety stairs
      that lead to the hayloft. I was moving so fast that one of the steps cracked.
      My foot broke through, and I stumbled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I caught myself on
      the next step, which held, and I peered into the loft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      was awake, sitting up, talking with Bryce. She was smiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      rushed to her and hugged her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I see you’ve been getting yourself
      into trouble while I wasn’t around to watch out for you,” Morgan said. She smiled
      at me then raised her eyebrows in Bryce’s direction. “Don’t even try to tell
      me you two behaved yourselves while I was out cold.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shut up!”
      I laughed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hugged Morgan again. Less than a day earlier, I’d
      thought that Morgan was dead. Now she was glowing. I tried not to start crying,
      but I did. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ll give you two a moment,” Bryce said. He climbed
      the stairs and left us alone, sitting in the loose hay. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How
      do you feel?” I asked. “Honestly, you look great.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the swelling
      around Morgan’s eyebrow had almost completely gone away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I <i>feel</i>
      great,” she whispered, confused. “I shouldn’t feel great, I know. Not after
      everything that happened. But I do. I don’t understand it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      remember what happened? Everything?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan nodded. “I think so,”
      she whispered. “I remember everything up to Ian shooting Robert. Shooting Mr.
      Hershel, I mean. I remember that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What happened after I dropped
      you at your house? Did he break in?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan looked away. “Not
      exactly.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What happened then?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She took a deep
      breath. “Okay. So,” she said. “You remember how I told you I was sleeping with
      someone else besides Jason?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I nodded. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It was
      him. I was sleeping with Robert Hershel. I had been for a couple weeks.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      couldn’t believe it. It was true that Mr. Hershel had always been one of those
      classically handsome cowboy types, or at least he was before his death, but
      he was at least in his sixties. He had a wife and grown kids. I couldn’t think
      of him as anything other than a sweet old man—before he cracked up and went
      totally insane, that is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You were having an affair with <i>Mr.
      Hershel</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You have no idea how much we never knew about Robert,”
      Morgan said. “I couldn’t believe the secrets I learned he’d been keeping. Did
      you know he used to have an account on this web site for married people who
      want to cheat on their spouses? I know that sounds creepy. It is, I guess. But
      at the same time, he was actually, like, the sweetest guy I’d ever met.” Now
      Morgan started to cry. She wiped her eyes. “I think I was a little bit in love
      with him. I know it sounds so stupid, but I was.” She heaved a sigh. “But, then,
      I don’t know what happened. He started getting more and more distant. Then he
      started getting really rough with me. And then, that night, I got home, and
      he was waiting for me there in nothing but that stupid holster he liked to wear
      when we were fooling around. But this time he was completely out of his mind.”
      She shrugged and looked into the distance. “And now he’s gone. So that’s the
      end of that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wondered if Morgan would say anything about Ian,
      or about kissing him. But either she didn’t remember or she didn’t want to say
      anything. I let it go. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Morgan,” I said. Mostly I couldn’t stop
      thinking about how much pain she’d been in when Ian and I got to her house.
      “I’m so, so, sorry what he did to you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She shrugged. “I lived.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      put a hand on her knee. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Look. A lot’s happened while you were
      unconscious,” I said. “Someone—the police or the military or someone, I don’t
      know exactly—they took Shawn and Ian from the house. We can’t even reach them.
      Their phones are off, and they’re not calling.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan shook her
      head. “What the fuck is going on around here?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That’s not all,”
      I said. “I’m so sorry, but I don’t think you’re safe, Morgan. Before Ian got
      taken away, he was really worried about you. He thought someone would come after
      you. I don’t know why, or who. But that’s why we’re here.” I gestured at the
      hayloft. “Bryce has been helping me keep you hidden.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“But . .
      . what? I don’t get it,” she said. “What would anyone want with me?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      don’t know, not exactly. But I think it has something to do with how you got
      so sick. I know you’re feeling better now, but Ian didn’t want to take you to
      the hospital because he was worried about what they’d do to you there.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      looked at my phone. I was going to be late for the funeral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      have to go to Mr. Hershel’s service,” I said. “There’s no way I can get out
      of it. I don’t really know if you’d even want to go or not, but you don’t really
      have the option. We can’t let anyone know where you are right now. You’ll have
      to stay here with Bryce. I promise I’ll be back in a couple hours. We’ll figure
      out what to do then. Okay?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan nodded. “Okay,” she said. “I
      won’t go anywhere. Look, I trust you. Just hurry back. Seriously. Hurry back.”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">M</span>r. Hershel’s service was at the farmhouse
      where he’d been born, grew up, and had spent his entire life. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because
      the roads were blocked off surrounding Muldoon and nothing could be shipped
      in or out, my Dad had volunteered to build a coffin from scratch. Mr. Hershel
      had been well over six feet tall, and the large, rough-hewn box dominated one
      end of the living room. Its lid was closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hardly anyone came.
      Mrs. Hershel sat silently throughout the service in the front row of the plastic
      chairs that someone had set up, but otherwise there were only a few close neighbors.
      Anyone who’d been able to leave Muldoon before the road blocks went up couldn’t
      get back into town now, and most people who were trapped here were too afraid
      to venture out of their homes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only were Ian and Shawn not
      there, there wasn’t a single male who wasn’t elderly or a child. I wondered
      if all the able-bodied men were being whisked away, just like my husband and
      brother-in-law. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried not to think about everything that was
      happening. I just needed to get through the funeral so I could get back to Morgan
      and Bryce and figure out what to do next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the pastor was going
      on and on. Just as he was finally completing his closing prayer, I heard someone
      rush into the room behind me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I turned, terrified that I’d see
      another military police officer sweeping into the room. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it
      wasn’t the military police. It was Bryce. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He kneeled to whisper
      into my ear. I was embarrassed. I could feel the eyes of everyone at the memorial
      service. Just about every one of them had seen me drunk and dancing with Bryce
      at the bar, and now here he was disrupting the pastor’s prayer by talking to
      me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What are you doing here?” I demanded as quietly as I could.
      “Did you leave Morgan? Is she alone?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We have to get out of here.”
      Bryce was scared. He was trying to pull me from my seat. “Someone came to your
      house,” he said. “Men, armed. I heard them calling out for Morgan. But not just
      her, Ashley. They were looking for<i> you</i> too.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sound
      of boot steps suddenly came up the porch. “<i>Now</i>,” Bryce said. “We have
      to go now.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pulled me into the adjoining kitchen just before
      a troop of armed military police filed into the living room. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What
      is this?” the pastor complained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There has been a warrant issued
      for the immediate detention of Morgan Hall, Ashley Young, and Reginald Wislowski.
      If any of these individuals is present on these premises, make yourself known.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      turned to Bryce. “They’re after <i>you</i> now, too?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He whispered,
      frightened, “What do they think I have to do with any of this?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thankfully,
      my dad had the wherewithal to lie to them. “I’ve never heard of any Reginald
      whoever,” he said in the other room. “But Ashley Young’s my daughter, and she’s
      not here. You know where she is? She’s out looking for her husband. Her husband
      who <i>you</i> people detained without any God damn good reason.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sir,”
      the military police officer said. “You’ll need to cooperate. If arrests are
      necessary, we won’t hesitate to make them.” He shouted, “Everybody out! One
      line in the driveway! Single file. Any personal identification you can provide
      at this time, have it ready.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We kept as quiet as we could in
      the kitchen while the living room emptied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now another squad
      of military police appeared at the back door. One peered in through the kitchen
      window. We had nowhere to flee other than back into the living room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      had been mostly emptied to make space for the rows of plastic chairs. Otherwise,
      the coffin was the only object in the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had barely a few
      seconds to figure out what to do before the military police finished searching
      the kitchen and pantry and then came into the living room. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly
      I flashed on something Ian had said before he’d been taken away. He’d said that
      he’d had to “take care” of Mr. Hershel’s body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still didn’t
      really understand what that meant, but on a desperate hunch I lifted the coffin’s
      lid. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was empty. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My hunch had been right. Ian
      must have hidden the body for some reason. But who was he trying to keep it
      from? And why? For now, I couldn’t waste time wondering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In here,”
      I said to Bryce, holding the coffin’s lid open. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was our
      only choice. We were surrounded. The only other option was to give ourselves
      up. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No fucking way!” Bryce stepped away from the strangely empty
      coffin. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At any moment the military police would be in the living
      room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s your choice,” I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without any better
      plan, I hopped up into the coffin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the kitchen, one of the
      military police shouted, “Clear!” Footsteps approached down the hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fuck
      it.” Bryce scrambled into the coffin beside me. He landed facing the opposite
      direction, with his feet at my head. I lowered the lid. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>From
      the darkness inside, we could hear the sound of scrambling boots and the shuffling
      of the plastic chairs that had been set out for the service. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now
      there came a tapping on the coffin. It was the tip of an assault rifle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We
      checking in here too?” said a voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another set of footsteps
      approached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve seen way too much lately to open up another
      fucking coffin,” said a second voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a pause. Neither
      of the men outside moved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the first voice very quietly
      said, “Me too.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their boots scraped away as the men left the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Are
      they gone?” Bryce whispered. “Let’s get the fuck out of here.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      listened. Another set of footsteps, softer than the last, was approaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Someone
      else is coming.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the softer footsteps approached the coffin.
      They stopped right beside us. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We heard someone set something
      on top of the coffin’s lid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was the sound of someone going
      through a bag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, next, there was the loud, grinding whir of
      an electric drill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone was screwing the coffin’s lid shut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Fuck,
      fuck, fuck</i>.” Bryce started hyperventilating. He couldn’t speak any louder
      than a terrified whisper. He pounded three times on the coffin’s lid. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then
      he stopped. His body went limp. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He’d passed out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hey!”
      I yelled. “<i>Hey!</i>”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started pounding on the lid. It was
      time to give myself up. I was ready to get out of this already over-heated,
      cramped space. The game was up. Whatever was going to happen to us after they
      arrested us couldn’t be any worse than getting locked inside a coffin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      the drilling didn’t stop. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard a second screw biting into
      the wood and felt the lid tighten. The meager light that had been making its
      way beneath the lid dimmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pounded again. “Hey! I’m in here.
      I’m <i>in</i> <i>here</i>!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shit,” someone said. It was a male
      voice, young. Maybe a teenager. “This is a loud one.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Don’t listen
      to it,” said another voice. It was another teenager. “You keep forgetting what
      they said in training.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I didn’t forget. It’s just loud this
      time.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, don’t even fucking say anything about it. When you
      say something it just makes it worse. Just pretend like you don’t hear anything.
      Let’s just get this over with.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pounded twice as hard on the
      lid. “Let me the <i>fuck out</i>! Someone’s in here!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drilling
      paused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s an <i>illusion</i>, remember?” the second voice
      said. “They’re <i>dead</i>. They’re not really conscious. It just <i>seems</i>
      like they are. They’re like <i>puppets,</i> remember? The bodies will die later.
      If we don’t do this, the disease is going to keep spreading. Give me the fucking
      drill.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another screw. Then another. The lid tightened again.
      The dim light vanished.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">F</span>or
      a while I went into a state of disconnected shock. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just couldn’t
      really believe that this was actually happening. I had this irrational sense
      that I was like some character in a video game who’d lost, but who would now
      just get to re-start from the beginning and try again. There had to be some
      way out. This wasn’t how I was going to die.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when I felt them
      move the coffin into a vehicle, I started pounding on the lid again and screaming.
      I didn’t stop, not even when I heard an engine start and felt myself being driven
      away. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I paused only long enough to try to catch my breath and
      pull my cell phone out of my pocket. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In small towns in the middle
      of nowhere, coverage is spotty. As soon as you get outside the city limits,
      you’re lucky if you get a signal. We were already out of range. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who
      would I have called, anyway? Ian and Shawn were unreachable. My Dad? What could
      he have done, even if I’d been able to reach him? The coffin was being escorted
      under armed, military protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I kept pounding and screaming,
      even though I was pretty sure there wasn’t anyone in the back of whatever truck
      or transport vehicle they’d put us in. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce’s legs began to
      stir at my shoulders. My head was wedged against his shoe. He was waking up.
      My arm was burning from pounding the lid, and I was going hoarse, but I didn’t
      stop pounding and screaming. When Bryce remembered where he was, he started
      pounding too. He was crying. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt the vehicle make a sharp
      turn, then we started jostling over a rough road. We came to a stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      was the sound of a sliding door opening. Then, in the distance, I could hear
      a large diesel engine and a slow beeping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a backhoe. I
      was certain of it. It sounded just like the one my dad had. The only reason
      anyone used a backhoe was to dig large, deep holes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce started
      sobbing harder and pounding the lid ferociously. For a moment I had a glimmer
      of hope when the wood splintered slightly under his fist. But realistically
      I knew there’d be no way he’d be able to break through. My dad was a good carpenter.
      The coffin was too strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Fuck you! Fuck you!</i>” Bryce
      was sobbing. His legs were flailing around, knocking into my shoulders. “<i>Fuck
      you!</i>” he screamed, again and again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We felt the coffin being
      lifted by the backhoe. Someone must have put a rope or a strap around it, because
      we started swaying. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we felt ourselves being lowered. We
      dropped farther, then farther down. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the coffin came
      to a rest. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither of us stopped pounding and screaming. “<i>Please!</i>”
      I heard myself shouting. “<i>Pleeeeease!”</i> I said it over and over again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then
      there came a deafening <i>whuuuf</i> as the backhoe dumped a load of hundreds
      of pounds of dirt over the lid. The coffin jolted. The wood creaked. There was
      another <i>whuuf</i> of falling dirt, this one muted and barely audible. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And
      then there was only silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">F</span>or
      a while neither of us spoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could hear Bryce crying to himself
      quietly. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A moment later, I felt him slip a hand under my knees.
      He drew a deep, shaky breath in the darkness. He wrapped both of his arms around
      my legs, hugging them. He was kind of like a little boy hugging a teddy bear
      in the middle of a dark night. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s hard to explain what I felt
      then. Mostly I didn’t want to think about the reality of what was happening.
      So maybe I was in denial. I don’t know. But there’s just something about the
      presence of the last human being you’ll ever be with in the world. You share
      something with that person that no one else could ever understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      put my hand on Bryce’s knee, then I hugged my arms around his legs too. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For
      a moment claustrophobia seized me intensely. But I closed my eyes so the darkness
      wouldn’t be as consuming, and I forced myself to pretend that I was just lying
      in bed beneath thick sheets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I’m going to say next will
      sound absolutely crazy, and probably perverse. But when you’re desperate to
      escape a horrific experience in any way possible, you find a way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      felt for Bryce’s belt buckle in the darkness. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I unclasped it,
      then I unbuttoned his jeans. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He froze. His entire body went rigid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m
      small, and the coffin was made for a large person, so I was able to bend my
      knees a little and maneuver myself lower in the narrow space. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      reached into Bryce’s underwear and brushed my fingers through the coils of his
      pubic hair. Then, very gently, I slipped my fingers around his penis. It was
      warm. I could feel his heart beating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His breathing deepened.
      He squeezed my legs tighter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was terrified of dying, but part
      of me felt more alive than I’d ever felt. A wave of obliterating attraction
      passed from my lips to my knees, then another. I didn’t want to think about
      anything but Bryce’s warm body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shifted his weight, and there
      was a moment of scooting his body around so that he could move his head inside
      my knees. Then he put his hand between my legs. I rotated my pelvis and pushed
      back against his touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled his pants and underwear down
      around his thighs as fast as I could. I put his penis in my mouth. For a moment,
      all I could think about was making him come. If I could focus on just this and
      the pressure of his fingertips between my legs, then it didn’t matter where
      I was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was breathing harder now, and he was moving his hips,
      but very, very gently. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt him unbutton my pants, suddenly,
      and in one motion he straightened my legs, pulled my pants and underwear together
      down to my ankles, and spread my legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His breath was suddenly
      on my naked vagina. Very softly, I felt his tongue begin to trace my labia.
      In the next moment it twisted around my clitoris. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t
      help but let out a gasp. His hands spread around my waist and down over my butt.
      I squeezed his penis, slid my lips over it again, and matched the rhythm of
      his tongue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I came before he did. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment
      I wasn’t trapped inside a narrow box. For a moment my world hadn’t gone to pieces.
      For a moment I was just a girl again. Unafraid. Alive. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He came
      right after. He must have been waiting for me. I felt his semen flow across
      my tongue. I squeezed my grip around his penis as tightly as I could. I hoped
      I’d made him feel as happy for a moment as he’d made me feel. I hoped I’d let
      him escape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I held his semen in my mouth and tried to catch my
      breath. In a moment of strange, irrational self-preservation I thought about
      Mr. Hershel and the horrific infestation of larvae that had filled his skull
      cavity. I thought about the illness that had almost killed Morgan soon after
      she’d been attacked. I thought about the body I’d help Ian carry from the locker
      room, and I thought about what the boy who’d locked us into the coffin had said
      about keeping the “disease” from spreading, and I quietly spit out Bryce’s semen.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew I was about to die anyway. I knew that I’d already had
      sex with Bryce, maybe even without a condom, and if he was carrying whatever
      terrifying disease that was causing people to act so bizarrely, he may have
      already passed it to me. Or maybe I’d even passed it to him. But there was something
      that just wouldn’t let me let go of keeping every chance for life open, no matter
      how small it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce hugged my legs again and rested his head
      on my inner thigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t want to die,” he whispered. He was
      no longer crying. It was just a simple, quiet statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled
      one of his knees up and lay my head on it. I rested my hand on his leg and very
      softly rubbed my thumb back and forth, just to let him know I was still there,
      and awake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He reached for my hand in the darkness and held on
      to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I clicked on my phone. Squinting in the sudden glare of
      the screen. I kept it on just long enough to see that there was only two percent
      of the battery left, and no reception to speak of. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I turned off
      the screen, lay my head back down on Bryce’s knee, and tried to prepare myself
      to die. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It occurred to me that if I kept turning on my phone,
      one time soon it wouldn’t turn back on, and after that I wouldn’t ever see any
      kind of light again.</p>\r\n</div>"

    - "<div class=\"blog_text\"><p>Now that I’ve finally finished Part 3, I feel like
      I could sleep for a day straight. I might just do that, in fact. As soon as
      I post this. I don’t have to go school, so why not? I’ll start Part 4 when I
      wake up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, I really hope everyone liked the third part of
      <i>Dead in Bed</i>. A lot happens in it, and it’s the longest segment yet. As
      always, you can feel totally free to tweet @BaileySimms with any questions.
      You can ask me anything except for what happens next! I can’t give the ending
      away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of you messaged me asking about “Kyle.” I guess I should
      stop using quotes and just get used to the pseudonym.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly,
      things could be better with Kyle. I think I made a mistake. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      know I shouldn’t be writing about this, even if I’m not using our real names.
      But I don’t have anyone to tell, not even my best friend—for reasons which maybe
      I’ll try to explain later, but not now. And I don’t think I can stand just keeping
      it all inside and not sharing it with anybody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, my dad finally
      turned our internet back on. I told him I’m doing a school project. Luckily
      he let me write all week without saying anything. As long as he doesn’t see
      what I’m actually writing, I think for now I’m okay. But Kyle didn’t know this.
      He was being so sweet, on Friday he showed up again and parked across the street
      in case I needed to use his iPad Wi-Fi. It was pretty late when I got his text,
      almost midnight. But I wasn’t asleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d been so irritated with
      my dad, and so sick of being stuck at home all day, and so <i>bored</i>, I kind
      of climbed out my window to go say hi to Kyle. My doctor would have killed me
      if he knew what I did, but I made it over the sill without hurting myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kyle
      was really surprised to see me. He definitely didn’t expect it. He was happy,
      I could tell, but he was worried I’d get in trouble too. We sat and listened
      to music for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then he kissed me. We’d never, ever
      kissed before. I had <i>so</i> many butterflies in my stomach when he leaned
      over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that’s when I made my mistake. I kind of . . . um .
      . . gave him a blowjob. (I hate that word, but I don’t know what else to call
      it.) I’d never given one before, and I’m almost seventeen. It wasn’t just because
      I needed to write the scene with Ashley and Bryce Tripp in the coffin and I
      didn’t really know how, in case you’re thinking that. It wasn’t just, like,
      research. I really like Kyle. A lot. And after he kissed me, I just wanted something
      else to happen. I didn’t want to go home. I wanted to make Kyle feel good. I
      wanted to make him feel at least as good as he made me feel every time he texted
      me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He kept telling me I didn’t have to do it, which kind of bothered
      me because he must have thought I felt obligated or something. When it was over,
      he got kind of distant and said he should go. He squeezed my hand. He was so
      worried that I was going to get in trouble. But, I don’t know. He was just acting
      weird. Like, not the same Kyle as before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The worst part is my
      dad found out he’d been parking outside our house. Thank God he didn’t catch
      me sneaking out—I’m sure he didn’t because I’d be in <i>so</i> much trouble
      by now if he’d seen me. But what he did do was call Kyle’s mom and told her
      to keep her son from “lurking” around our house. It was so embarrassing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway.
      I texted Kyle afterwards, and he still hasn’t gotten back to me. That was two
      nights ago. He probably hates me. I’m really, really scared I ruined everything.
      I’m sure he thinks I’m a slut. I know I really made a huge mistake. I don’t
      know why I did it. I’m so, so sorry. (I wish you could just read this and see
      how sorry I am.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve decided the best thing to do is focus on
      writing Part 4. After I get some sleep that is. I’m actually really excited
      about what’s coming up next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\r\n\r\n<p

    - "<div class=\"novel_text\"><p><span class=\"first_letter\">M</span>y phone’s
      battery charge ticked down from two percent to one percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      shifted my weight and changed the angle of my head on Bryce’s knee. I managed
      to find a slightly less cramped position. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>We’re just in bed</i>,
      I kept trying to tell myself. <i>We’re just in bed, under the covers, in a dark
      room. Soon, I’ll just fall to sleep.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was scrolling through
      photos of my family. Any second now my phone’s screen would switch off, and
      I wanted to see everyone one last time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was looking at Tyler
      and Haley in the photo I took of them before Tyler’s first football game. He
      was lifting Haley off her feet, and they were both smiling ecstatically. I flipped
      to the next image. There was Shawn and me right after our wedding. He was thinner
      and looking happier than I’d seen him in a long time. Flip. There was my mom,
      knitting on the sofa. Flip. And there was my dad. He was fishing. He was sitting
      in the old lawn chair he always took to the river, gazing at the camera with
      the gentle look that was unique to my Dad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt my chin start
      to quiver. Tears started to well in my eyes. I couldn’t help it. Of all the
      people I’d never see again, I thought I’d miss my dad more than anyone else.
      I tried to cry quietly so Bryce wouldn’t hear me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wiped my eyes
      with my shirt collar. When I opened them a text had appeared on the phone’s
      screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could this be possible? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked at the
      cell reception meter. One tiny bar had appeared, then it quickly vanished. For
      a moment my phone must have gotten just enough reception for an old text to
      come through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was from Shawn:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>i know where
      u r</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>why out there? </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>r u with bryce
      t?</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My eyes flashed over the text, then I read it over a second
      time. What did it mean? How could Shawn know where I was? Had he somehow traced
      my phone? Did he know I’d been buried alive? If so, what did he mean by “out
      there?” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My phone’s screen went black. The battery was dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>t started as a low rumbling sound.
      I was breathing so fast now I could barely hear it, but it was there. I was
      taking in deep gulps of air, and I still felt like I needed even deeper and
      deeper breaths. I’d never experienced any feeling like this except maybe in
      high school after I’d sprinted around the track. I knew I was about to pass
      out any minute now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coffin started to creak, and as the rumbling
      noise grew louder the earth started to shake a little. Bryce, breathing as frantically
      as I was, started banging on the lid. Little bits of dirt fell on our faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      I felt the coffin lurch, for a moment I thought it had caved in. But then I
      realized we were being pulled out of the ground. Before I could even process
      the fact that we’d been saved, someone had pried open the lid by a couple of
      inches. There was a flood of cool air and bright light. I swallowed gasps of
      the fresh oxygen as if I’d just been deep under water. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      kicked the lid fully open. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sky was overcast, but it took
      a moment for my eyes to adjust to the sudden daylight. Someone was kneeling
      over the coffin with a crow bar. A man. He was wearing a combat helmet. As his
      face faded into view, I found myself staring at the last person in the world
      I thought I’d see. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Jason Gibbs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hadn’t
      thought about Jason since I’d broken through the police barricade at the fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fucking
      hell,” he said. He turned and called out over his shoulder, “Just in fucking
      time!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then I saw who he was calling to. It was Shawn. He was
      climbing down from a backhoe. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason held out his hand and helped
      me out of the coffin. I was still dizzy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Jesus Christ, Ashley,”
      he said. “You better be so fucking glad we got issued these GPS phone trackers.
      How the fuck did you two get in there?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ignored him and tried
      to make sense of what I was seeing. We were in an open field whose soil had
      been heavily turned over. In addition to Shawn and Jason, three other men where
      standing around an idling backhoe. All of them were wearing the same kind of
      combat gear as the men who had come to the house: helmets, flak jackets, boots,
      and they were all carrying semi-automatic rifles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn kept his
      gun casually pointed at Bryce while another of the men put him in handcuffs.
      He hadn’t even stepped out of the coffin yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What is this?”
      Bryce was still catching his breath. “You can’t do this. Why are you doing this?”
      Bryce looked at his bound wrists, bewildered. “You can’t . . . Are you the police
      or what?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Home Guard rangers.” My husband was speaking in an
      official tone I’d never heard him use before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason shoved Bryce
      with his rifle. “Just finished crash training yesterday, bitch!” He grabbed
      Bryce’s arm and dragged him toward a huge military vehicle parked behind us.
      “And your ass is under arrest!” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn held a pair of handcuffs
      toward me. For a moment I had an irrational flash of pride that he was finally
      applying himself. But instead of joining the highway patrol he’d become some
      kind of paramilitary Nazi. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Give me your hands,” he said. He
      wouldn’t even look at me. “Give me your hands, ma’am.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I gingerly
      held out my hands. “Shawn, why are you doing this?” I searched the faces of
      the other so-called rangers. I didn’t recognize any of them. “Where’s <i>Ian</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn
      wouldn’t answer. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m your <i>wife</i>,” I pleaded. “What is
      this?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My husband just cinched the handcuffs tightly around my
      wrists. I looked around, trying to get my bearings. There were two other backhoes
      parked on the loose soil, the military vehicle, and otherwise just a low, gray
      sky. We were someplace far outside of town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What is this place?”
      I tried to look Shawn in the eye. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>No response. Shawn and one
      of the other men grabbed my shoulders and put me in back of the military vehicle,
      next to Bryce. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Tell me what’s going <i>on!</i>” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That’s
      classified information for my rank,” Shawn said. “You’ll have to ask the sergeant.”
      He nodded toward Jason, who was climbing into the driver’s seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The
      <i>sergeant?</i>”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Mass grave!” Jason shouted out into the rear-view
      mirror. “You two were lucky as fuck!”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">O</span>utside
      of Muldoon is a truck stop with a U-Haul center and a massive, warehouse-sized
      engine shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the first recognizable landmark I saw when
      Jason approached the highway. I expected him to pass it by, but he turned into
      the truck stop and pulled right into the warehouse. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside were
      countless U-Haul trucks, row after row of them. They’d all been stripped of
      their engines and were in various states of disassembly. Jason came to a stop
      beside one van without wheels, its axles resting on the concrete floor. Two
      of the men pulled Bryce from his seat, shoved him into the back of the U-Haul,
      slammed its door down, and locked it shut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shawn.” I tried to
      sound calm and reasonable, but I had no idea why we were here or what was happening.
      “Please tell me what’s going on.” I steadied my breath. “Just tell me what you’re
      doing.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn kept quiet. No one else said a word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now
      Jason maneuvered the military vehicle around scattered hydraulic jacks and made
      his way toward the opposite end of the warehouse. He stopped beside another
      U-Haul truck, this one with its entire front end missing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason
      himself jerked me from my seat. He shoved me into the back of the U-Haul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Shawn!</i>”
      I screamed out. “What’s <i>going on</i>? Tell me!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could see
      my husband’s profile in the military vehicle’s passenger seat. He didn’t even
      turn to look at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason reached up and grabbed the cord dangling
      from the U-Haul’s sliding door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You just hang tight,” he said
      with a terrifying grin. “We’ll let you know, Ma’am!” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then he
      slammed the door shut. I heard him lock it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again I was
      in a dark space, this time completely alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>
      can’t say for sure how long I was locked inside the back of the van, but it
      must have been for around five days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At what felt like twenty-four
      hour intervals, two men in combat gear, kids really, opened the U-Haul’s door.
      One always kept his rifle aimed at my chest. The other would set vacuum-packed
      military rations and a gallon of water on the cargo space’s floor. Then they
      slammed the door back down and locked it. They must have been given orders not
      to speak to me, because I couldn’t ever get either of them to say a word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sitting
      there in the dark, mostly I thought about Morgan. I’d promised her that I’d
      come right back to the hayloft, but I’d never returned. I wondered if she was
      still waiting there. I wondered if someone had found her. I tried not to think
      about what Jason had said about a “mass grave” and what the workers who had
      locked us into the coffin had said about burying other people who’d cried out
      from inside. A couple of times I tried calling out to Bryce as loud as I could,
      but I never heard any response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started fantasizing that the
      next time someone opened the cargo door, it would be Ian. But of course it never
      was. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">T</span>he
      fifth time the door rolled up, not only was it not Ian, and not only was there
      no food, it was Jason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’re official!” He ducked into the cargo
      space and flashed me a bright grin. He was in the same combat gear as before.
      “We got warrants now! And they sure do want to talk to <i>you</i>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      grabbed me by the handcuffs and painfully threw me into the military vehicle
      he’d been driving before. Bryce was in the back seat. He was relieved to see
      me; he tried to give me an embrace, but his handcuffs got in the way. He eyed
      the armed squad warily—the same men as before—and settled for putting his hand
      on my knee and squeezing it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn sat stone-still in the front
      seat. He didn’t even turn around to look at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">D</span>owntown
      Muldoon was completely deserted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Jason drove through on the
      highway, there were cars parked everywhere, but all of them had been abandoned.
      I didn’t see a soul. Another military vehicle passed going in the opposite direction,
      but that was it. The carnival rides, still standing at the fairgrounds, were
      darkly motionless. The diner was closed; the supermarket was closed; the post
      office had a notice posted on its door, but I couldn’t see what it said. Some
      of the shops still had their “open” signs up, but they were obviously totally
      empty. Only the pharmacy’s lights were on, and some kind of electronic steel
      door had been put up at its entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the men raised his
      rifle as we approached the Burger Shack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sergeant, we got something.”
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I see it.” Jason slowed. “Good fucking eyes, Corporal!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn
      gestured at me and Bryce. “Let’s just get these two to the center,” he said
      to Jason. “We don’t have enough room. Let’s skip this one.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason
      shook his head. “We won’t <i>need</i> room.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pulled into the
      Burger Shack drive-through lane. An empty car was parked at the order kiosk.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after being locked inside a coffin and then a U-Haul, I
      was feeling constricted in the handcuffs. I worried if something happened I
      wouldn’t be able to move or defend myself. I glanced at Bryce, but he shook
      his head and shrugged helplessly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the men pointed his gun
      through the window at the parked car. “Right there.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t
      tell what they were looking at. Then I noticed that the car was moving, very
      slightly. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was rocking back and forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Jesus
      fucking Christ,” another of rangers whispered, disgusted. “They’re in there
      all right.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the men stayed to guard me and Bryce while
      the rest got out of the vehicle. Jason, Shawn, and another ranger, the corporal,
      approached the car. I wasn’t sure what I was about to see, but something told
      me I’d regret watching it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The corporal positioned himself at
      one side of the car, and Jason the other. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason gave a silent
      count. Then they whipped open one door each. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone screamed.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason dragged a girl from the car by her ankle, and the corporal
      dragged out another person, a guy, by the collar. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Wait! Wait!”
      the guy shouted, covering his head with his arms. “We were just sleeping!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      recognized him. I’d gone to high school with him. He was a couple of years ahead
      of me. His name was Patrick something. He’d been in the band, he played something
      like the trombone, and now he stocked shelves at the supermarket. He was wearing
      a green t-shirt and his pants were unbuttoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Like <i>hell</i>
      you were sleeping,” Jason said. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason struggled with the girl.
      She was pulling her skirt down from around her waist and trying to stand up.
      He put his knee on her chest, pinning her to the pavement. She slapped at his
      knee, flinging her bleached hair, but otherwise she was silent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Get
      off her!” Patrick yelled, his voice cracking. He struggled as the corporal pinned
      him against the car’s trunk. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the corporal took something
      that looked like a home pregnancy test from his flak jacket and jabbed it into
      Patrick’s lower abdomen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick screamed out in what looked like
      intense pain, and collapsed onto the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason held back the
      girl’s hands and jabbed a similar white plastic applicator into her stomach,
      just above her pubic bone. She writhed in agony, but still without making a
      sound. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What’s yours?” Jason stood, shaking his applicator. “Stage
      one? Bet it’s stage one.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no idea what just happened or
      what Jason was talking about. The whole time Shawn kept quiet. He just pointed
      his gun back and forth between Patrick and the girl. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The corporal
      looked closely at his applicator. “Stage one!” He smiled. “Bingo! What’s yours?
      Stage two, I bet. Look at her. Gotta be stage two.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hold on,
      it’s coming.” Jason shook his applicator and looked at it again. “Stage two!”
      He yelled. “Corporal, we got ourselves a couple of officially confirmed sickos!”
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason held up his white plastic applicator and tapped it against
      the corporal’s like they were clinking glasses for a toast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’re
      already almost out of these.” The corporal tossed his applicator into the bushes
      beside the Burger Shack. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Next shipment’s supposed to be in soon.”
      Jason shrugged. “Not like we really need these things anyway. Waste of time,
      if you ask me. I mean, big fucking surprise these two are sick, right?” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      drew a handgun. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Are you ready?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick was trying
      to stand, clutching his abdomen. They girl was still writhing on the ground.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The corporal drew his own handgun. “Ready.” He took a deep breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason
      nodded. He placed his gun against the girl’s head. The corporal placed his against
      Patrick’s. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>They both immediately fired, almost exactly at the
      same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick collapsed. The girl shuddered, then went still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>What
      the fuck!</i>” I yelled out, mindlessly banging my cuffed hands against the
      seat in front of me. “<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>” I was suddenly sobbing.
      I couldn’t believe what I’d seen. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d never thought that even
      Jason could do anything like this. Patrick and the girl lay dead in gathering
      pools of blood at the rangers’ feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Your turn, this time,” Jason
      said to the corporal. “Bag ‘em and bury ‘em.”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">T</span>he
      corporal stayed behind with a pair of body bags. Jason drove out of town, following
      the highway to the west and toward the mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t stop
      crying. I felt like I was going to break in half. I’d been through more than
      I could handle. Bryce was silent, riding with his head pressed against the window.
      I couldn’t tell what he was thinking. It looked like he’d kind of shut down.
      Shawn sat beside Jason with his gaze fixed forward. If it weren’t for his combat
      helmet it would have looked like he was just working some desk job. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Holy
      Fuck.” Jason was driving us past a dairy farm in the middle of a broad hay field,
      and now he craned his neck to look out the window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I kept wondering
      where Ian was. I knew he wouldn’t put up with any of this new Home Guard ranger
      cowboy shit, and I was worried about what they’d done with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      were only four men now that the corporal had stayed behind. I decided that if
      I got another chance, I’d run. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason pulled to the side of the
      road. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ladies and gentlemen! I do believe we have a clusterfuck.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Clusterfuck?
      Where?” One of the rangers, the youngest of them, peered out the window. “I
      haven’t seen one yet. Where is it?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Out past that tree, Private.
      Right there.” Jason brought the vehicle to a stop. “See it?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      was a low mass of . . . <i>something</i> in the field just beyond the dairy
      barn, partially obscured by an idle swather. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason pulled the
      military vehicle into the farm. As we drove through the field, moving closer,
      I could see that the mass was actually thirty or forty people. They had gathered
      in a tight circle. Most of them were sitting or lying in the dirt, almost as
      if they were having a group picnic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Holy <i>fuck</i>.” Shawn
      opened the door as Jason brought the vehicle to a stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it
      was no picnic. The people in the field—all thirty or forty of them—were having
      sex. It was some kind of orgy. Many of them were completely naked; some of the
      men’s pants were around their ankles; some of the women had two guys between
      their legs. When Jason cut the engine, I could hear a chorus of quivering moans.
      Everyone was filthy, covered in dust and dry alfalfa. I’d never, ever seen anything
      like it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Watch this,” Jason said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He gave the horn
      a long honk. It was deafening. He flicked the siren on and off, which was even
      louder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one in the field stopped having sex. Not one of them
      even paused or looked up. If anything, the moaning grew more intense. It was
      like they were all lost in a trance of carnal insatiability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Why
      do they do that?” asked the younger private. “Why don’t they run?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Because
      they’re fuckin’ sickos,” Jason said. “Just look at them. Shameless.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“But
      we only have like three test kits left.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason laughed. He banged
      on the horn again. None of the people in the field responded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There’s
      your test. Every fuckin’ one of them is stage three. I guarantee it.” Jason
      looked into the rear view mirror. “Anyone disagree with that assessment?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn
      said, “Fuck protocol.” He shouldered his rifle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the rangers
      got out of the vehicle and approached the massive orgy, guns raised, making
      their way around the idle swather. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hold up,” Jason said. “Don’t
      waste your ammo.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He climbed into the swather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Keys
      are here!” He called out, jangling a set of ignition keys out the door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh
      <i>shit</i>.” The private grinned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A swather is basically a giant
      lawn mower that cuts a twenty-foot-wide swath of hay and spits it out the back
      into a neat row. They’re hard to maneuver, and Jason wasn’t nearly as good a
      driver as my dad was. He started the engine and struggled to steer the swather
      toward the orgy that was playing out in the field. The other Home Guard rangers
      chuckled and clapped, including Shawn, goading Jason on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t
      believe this was happening. I couldn’t<i> let</i> it happen. I stumbled out
      of the military vehicle and ran awkwardly in my handcuffs toward the swather.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Stop!” I yelled. “Jason! <i>Stop!</i>” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The men
      laughed at me. There was nothing I could do. I was a small woman in handcuffs,
      and Jason was driving a giant hydraulic machine with churning blades. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Get
      the fuck back, Ashley!” Shawn yelled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I collapsed in the field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason
      maneuvered around me, then steered directly toward the mass of people still
      obliviously fucking on the ground. Finally a few of the people, one guy and
      two women, got up and ran. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the rangers shot them. They twisted
      to the ground like hunted geese, then the rangers shot them each again in the
      head. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason drove directly into the cluster of bodies who still
      hadn’t run. There was a nightmarish sound of chopped flesh and the sudden scent
      of exposed bowels as the swather churned into the cluster of human beings. Most
      of the people didn’t even stop having sex until the moment before they died.
      The swather deposited a trail of chopped limbs and viscera in its wake. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn
      was smiling and nodding while the two other privates cheered triumphantly and
      slapped hands. Then the younger private suddenly threw up. The others laughed
      at him, including Shawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was too much. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m
      sure I must have known at least some of these people before they’d contracted
      whatever hellishly bizarre plague was spreading through Muldoon. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      vomited. I stood and ran. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sprinted as fast as I could through
      the stubble wearing handcuffs, then I tripped over a tangle of dried alfalfa,
      pitched forward, and fell. I got up and ran again. I was heading for the dairy
      barn, but it was at least a hundred yards away. I waited for a bullet to tear
      into my back. Any second now I would feel lead ripping through my flesh, I was
      sure of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead someone pulled me down by the hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was one of the privates. He started dragging me back to the military vehicle,
      still clutching my hair. I thought he would rip it out by the roots in a clump.
      I grasped for his wrists to hold up my weight as he dragged me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Don’t
      shoot her!” Shawn yelled. “I wish like hell we could, but they’re wanted for
      questioning!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I know, I know,” said the private, still dragging
      me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason jogged over, waving his hand at the private. “Hey man,
      hold up. Hold up.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The private let go of my hair and Jason helped
      me stand. The private obediently walked ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason put his arm
      around me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m watching out for you, Ash,” he whispered. “Don’t
      forget that. I’ve got you. I’ll take care of you. We’ll just get you all checked
      out, make sure you’re clean. I know you been through a hell of a lot. But I’m
      here for you. I can help you take the edge off.” As he guided me toward the
      military vehicle, he pressed a couple of round pills into my palm. “These’ll
      make you feel better. Remember, Ash, I’m here to help you take the edge off,
      in any way you want.” He squeezed my shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn’t release
      his firm grip as he lead me all the way back to the vehicle. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      didn’t think I could be any more sickened by Jason after what he’d just done
      with the swather, but I was. I was so distraught and angry, I thought I’d collapse
      again. I didn’t really understand exactly what he meant by <i>take the edge
      off</i>, but I got the gist. I knew he’d do anything he wanted to me, given
      the chance. I held on to the pills he gave me only to avoid pissing him off.
      I would have rather died than be held captive by Jason Gibbs, but that was exactly
      what was happening. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gunshots rang out. A burst of rapid fire.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rangers lifted their weapons, startled. I ducked down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      thought someone was shooting at us, but when I glanced up I saw a man approaching
      us from a dark military SUV. He was dressed in a black version of the combat
      uniforms the rangers were wearing, shooting not at us but into the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Stop,”
      he called out, firing his rifle again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rangers lowered their
      weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What is it?” Jason yelled back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What
      is it, <i>sir</i>,” the man barked as he approached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What is
      it, sir,” Jason mumbled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m taking these two off your hands.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was only now that I realized the man approaching was Ian. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t
      know whether to cry out in relief at seeing him or to be terrified that he was
      one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian held out a wad of documents in his free hand.
      “I’ve got clearance papers,” he said. “They’ve been cleared.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason
      shook his head in frustrated disbelief. “But we’re taking them in! They’re wanted
      for questioning!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Not any more they’re not.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      gently put his hand on my shoulder and nodded at Bryce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Get in
      the car. Right now.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce and I both hurried toward the SUV.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind me, I heard Ian yell out at Shawn. “How <i>dare</i> you!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fuck
      you, Ian,” Shawn called back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By then Bryce and I had climbed
      into Ian’s SUV. Ian jumped into the driver’s seat and slammed the door. He handed
      me a set of handcuff keys and started the ignition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What’s going
      on?” I was sobbing. “Tell me what’s going on. I need somebody to tell me what’s
      going on.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian sped through the field toward the highway. “They
      think you’ve been harboring infected fugitives,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked
      back. Jason, Shawn, and the other rangers were still milling around the mass
      of tangled limbs. They weren’t following us. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached the highway.
      I was still too terrified to fully let my guard down, but finally I let out
      a huge sob of relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian put his hand on my shoulder. I pressed
      my cheek against it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I know what happened to you guys,” Ian
      said quietly, glancing also at Bryce in the back seat. “I’m so sorry, Ash.”
      He squeezed my shoulder, very softly. “I can’t even begin to imagine.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      said, “Thank you.” It sounded like he was trying not to cry too. “Jesus, buddy,”
      he said to Ian. “Thank you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could barely unlock the handcuffs
      because my fingers were trembling so bad. I passed the keys back to Bryce. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      realized I was still clutching the pills Jason had given me. I stared at them
      dumbly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian grabbed them from my palm, rolled down the window,
      and threw them outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Jason gave those to you?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      nodded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Jesus Christ.” Ian shook his head, disgusted. “He’s a
      little piece of shit.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What were they?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sedatives,
      tranquilizers. Who knows? He’s got access to the pharmacy and he already thinks
      he’s some kind of drug kingpin.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Jason had been planning to
      drug me and force himself on me. I can’t even imagine what someone like him
      would have done to me if he’d had me locked up in some jail cell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Thank
      you, Ian,” I said. “Fucking thank you so much.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’re okay,”
      he said. “You’re safe. For now. I was able to pull some strings and get your
      arrest warrants cleared. But we’re going to have to be careful.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried to calm down. I still couldn’t stop shaking. I couldn’t keep my thoughts
      straight. All I could think about was wanting Ian to just pull over and hold
      me in his arms while I cried. I knew I shouldn’t want that, it was wrong, but
      I couldn’t help it. I took a deep breath and tried to get myself under control.
      We were passing back into town. Ian slowed to avoid the empty, abandoned cars
      that were strewn all over the roadside. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What’s <i>happening</i>?”
      I asked. “They took you away, Ian. And now you’re . . . What <i>are</i> you?
      What’s <i>going on</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian drew a deep breath, gave me a look
      of what I tried not to interpret as despair, then stared at the road. “Everything’s
      falling to pieces,” he said. “That’s what’s happening.” He shook his head. “We’re
      inside what’s now an officially designated quarantine zone. All of Muldoon and
      the surrounding areas. About forty miles across. They’ve got the National Guard
      patrolling the borders. I swear to God the perimeter looks like Iraq. Hesco
      barriers, concertina wire, the whole thing. And I guess we’re not the only zone.
      There’s supposed to be four more throughout the west, all in remote, rural areas,
      like us.” He shook his head. “I can’t believe how fast they set this thing up
      since the pathogen broke out. I guess no one really understands how to cure
      it, or how it works, except that it’s a kind of venereal disease and somehow
      it drives people mad with carnal desire. It’s basically an STD that acts as
      an aphrodisiac.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian glanced at me. I couldn’t believe it, but
      he blushed a little. He cleared his throat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Officially,” he said,
      “the federal government’s supposed to lift the quarantines when everyone living
      inside tests negative for a full twelve months. The pathogen’s supposed to be
      contained inside the zones. But, unofficially, word is they’re dumping infected
      people in from the outside. And I’ve sure seen a lot of infected people around
      who I don’t know. Can’t all be outsiders stuck here from the fair.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      couldn’t really believe that everything had changed so fast just because an
      aggressive disease was spreading. I was finding it hard to comprehend that I
      wasn’t still living in the same old Muldoon, and that everything about our lives
      had changed, probably forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What happened when they took you
      away?” I looked at Ian’s black combat uniform warily. He still hadn’t told me
      everything. “What <i>are</i> you now, exactly . . . ?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Home Guard.”
      He scoffed. “Either you join, or you get thrown into detention. Indefinitely.
      That’s the deal. It’s basically a paramilitary force that’s been granted the
      rule of martial law over the entire quarantine zone. They recruit a lot people
      from the inside, because, well, how many volunteers are you going to get from
      the outside to go into a quarantine zone? They take you to this center they
      have set up west of town, give you some bullshit day-long crash training course,
      assign you a rank, and off you go. Because of my experience they cooked up a
      medical lieutenant rank for me. Everybody else keeps busy doing the rounds patrolling
      residences and taking daily urine tests, then separating out the infected from
      the uninfected. We were supposed to bring anyone who tested positive to the
      center, where they were going to keep them all in that Wal-Mart warehouse over
      there. But now it looks like all the squads are pretty much just ‘expiring’
      positives on the spot.” Ian looked at me with a mixture of awe and fear at what
      he was about to tell me. “They’re getting away with killing people because there’s
      a legal loophole. Anyone who tests positive, technically, is already dead.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      didn’t understand. “What do you mean? How is that possible? That doesn’t make
      any sense.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Do you remember Chris Trevino? That new doctor kid?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      vaguely remembered a young doctor who’d started at the hospital just about the
      time Shawn was finishing up his physical therapy. But I didn’t know what he
      had to do with anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yeah, I remember him. I guess so. Why?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      had been driving toward my parents’ house, but now he turned off the unpaved
      road that lead around to the back side of their property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,
      you’ll meet him soon,” Ian said. “Chris’ll be able to explain everything better
      than I ever could. He’s a good guy. Young, a little high-strung, but a good
      enough guy. We’ve been helping each other out. He sort of defected from the
      hospital when the Home Guard took it over. After Bob Hershel died, he asked
      me if I knew where he could do an autopsy without anyone finding out about it.
      I found him a place.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought about Ian shooting Mr. Hershel
      that night. It already seemed like so long ago when Morgan had fallen into her
      coma. The last I’d seen of her, she’d been hidden away in my dad’s hayloft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And
      Morgan?” I asked. I was terrified that she wouldn’t have known what to do when
      neither Bryce nor me had come back to the loft. What if she’d been caught by
      the Home Guard?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Morgan’s . . . safe,” Ian said. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      he didn’t say anything further, and I could tell he was holding something back
      that he didn’t want to tell me.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>an
      pulled up toward the ramshackle barn that had stood precariously by the river
      for as long I could remember. It was on the Hershel property, across the river
      from my parents’ ranch. I got out to open the barn doors, and Ian parked the
      SUV inside, hiding it from view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’ll leave it here in case
      anyone tries to track it,” Ian explained. He locked the doors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      and I followed Ian toward the low concrete dam that spanned the river from bank
      to bank. As kids, my sister and I used to take our shoes off and cross by walking
      through the ankle-deep water that spilled over the dam’s edge, but now Bryce
      and I just followed Ian’s lead and sloshed through in our shoes, too tired and
      shaken to care about not getting our feet wet. I had no idea where Ian was taking
      us. We were more than a quarter mile from my parents’ house. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      dad used to raise grain before I was born, and there was still an old corrugated
      tin granary left over on the flats along the river, more or less hidden behind
      the bluff. I hadn’t even seen it for years. My dad used to make me and Danielle
      swear we wouldn’t play inside the tall, barn-like structure that housed the
      old grain elevator. It was connected to a row of six squat silos, long since
      empty. Every surface of the granary was corrugated tin, and by now all of the
      tin had rusted to a dull orange. Ian walked through the weeds toward the granary’s
      door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ll take you to the house in just sec,” he said. “I just
      need to check in on Chris real quick.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked around at the
      old rusting structure. An arrow-shaped weather vane creaked at the rooftop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Does
      my dad know you’re using this place?” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It made me a little nervous
      that Ian was hiding bodies from the Home Guard on my parents’ property. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      told him I needed to use it,” he answered. “I also told him I couldn’t tell
      him why. He agreed. He swore he wouldn’t tell a soul about anything going on
      down here. I know he won’t.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian was right. I knew that if my
      dad swore not to say anything to anyone, he wouldn’t. He could keep a secret,
      even from my mom. Once he’d taken me on a cross-country horseback trip into
      the mountains way beyond town, and passing through a gully we stumbled into
      an abandoned village of ancient native American cliff dwellings. We spent the
      afternoon walking up and down the stone steps and exploring the network of rooms
      carved into the rock. We even found petrified corncobs in one. He told me he
      didn’t think anyone knew that the native American group who had built them had
      ever migrated so far north, and he didn’t want backpackers ruining the place.
      He made me swear to keep it a secret, and he never, ever said a word about it
      later, not even to me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What about my mom?” I asked Ian. I knew
      she wouldn’t be happy about him using the granary. “Does she know you’re using
      it?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian shook his head. “No, just your dad.” He opened the granary
      door. It creaked in its wire hinges. “You don’t have to come in if you don’t
      want to. You’ve seen a hell of lot today. I wouldn’t blame you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was feeling so numb I just followed Ian inside. Bryce came in too, I think mostly
      so he wouldn’t have to stay outside alone. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior was dark,
      shot through by points of light coming in through tiny holes rusted into the
      tin walls. Everything was covered by decades-old grain dust. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hey,
      Chris!” Ian called out. “It’s me. I have company.” His voice echoed strangely
      through the massive tin building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As my eyes adjusted once again
      to a dark space, this one far more cavernous than the last, I recognized the
      doctor who was sitting at a makeshift desk in the far corner. The desk was surrounded
      by medical supplies from boxes of antibiotics to a battery-powered defibrillator
      to empty I.V. bags hanging on nails. There was even an old heart monitor, though,
      as it appeared, it was without a power supply. Ian had obviously been busy bringing
      Doctor Trevino more than just cadavers to study. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The doctor stood
      as we walked in. He was even younger than I’d remembered, not much older than
      I was, small and thin, and he was waving smoke from the air. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      was holding a joint, not entirely guiltily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hey,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This
      is Doctor Trevino.” Ian eyed the joint warily. “Chris,” he said disapprovingly.
      “What is this? Really?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hey man, when you come to a bum-fuck
      town in the middle of nowhere for a one-year residency and end up stuck in a
      quarantine zone, probably for life, you want to allow yourself a joint every
      now and then. That’s my medical advice.” He shook my hand, then Bryce’s. “Hi,
      how are you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian waved away the smoke. “Ashley wanted to know
      why the Home Guard can shoot the sick at will,” Ian said. “I told her you could
      explain it better than me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Because they’re not sick.” He shrugged.
      “They’re dead.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Go easy,” Ian whispered. “They’ve been through
      a lot. Remember? I told you what happened?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh shit! I’m so sorry!”
      Chris covered his mouth. “You guys where in the . . . buried . . . thing. Right.
      Shit. I’m so sorry.” He touched each of our shoulders apologetically and stepped
      back. “Well, you’re alive. So congratulations for that. That’s better than the
      TGV-positives can say, because, like I said, they’re not. They’re dead.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Okay,”
      Bryce said. He’d been in a state of shock for the last hour or so, and now he
      was losing his patience. “You’ll have to explain this. I’m not a doctor, but
      what the fuck do you mean <i>dead</i>? Like fucking zombies or something? Bullshit.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No,
      not like zombies.” Chris sat down at his makeshift desk. “They’re totally conscious.
      They don’t feel any different, not at first anyway.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He leaned
      back and dragged from his joint, then he released the smoke, eyeing us. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Okay,
      so,” he said. “Here’s the deal. Have you ever heard of Toxoplasmosis? The disease
      that’s caused by Toxoplasma Gondii? It’s a parasite that reproduces inside cat
      intestines and causes infected mice to be sexually attracted to cats, making
      it easier for cats to eat them. It’s real. I’m serious. Look it up. It even
      causes higher rates of risk-taking behavior and suicide when it gets inside
      humans. Well, as far as we know, the plague pathogen is a mutation of Toxoplasma
      Gondii, one that’s evolved to use humans as hosts instead of mice and cats.
      They think a strain got into a bunch of chickens in one of those giant factory
      farms—probably from cat shit in the chicken feed. That’s where it mutated, and
      then somebody somewhere must have eaten some undercooked chicken, and then it
      mutated again and really took off in the human population. Toxoplasma Gondii
      Five. TGV. This strain’s entirely sexually transmitted. In fact, in women and
      men both, the parasite is only released through orgasm. After sleeping with
      someone who’s infected, people get flu-like symptoms and slip into a coma. Anywhere
      from a few hours to a few days later, they die.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris took one
      last drag from his joint then stubbed it out in an ashtray made from the bottom
      of soda can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This is where it gets weird,” he said. “Death triggers
      the parasite to take control of the amygdalae—they’re in the limbic system,
      where all the most basic, primitive functions are located. The infected person
      wakes up, feeling healthy, and with all of the brain’s original personality
      and memory centers intact. They’re basically normal, but with two exceptions.
      Number one, they’re dead. Number two, just like in mice where they first evolved,
      the host’s libido is stimulated. That’s because the parasite has begun to lay
      its microscopic eggs in the tissues of the host’s reproductive organs. We don’t
      really understand how, but it makes infected humans do virtually anything to
      do the wild thing. To <i>get it on</i>. The <i>humpty dumpty</i>. Know what
      I’m saying, people? There’s evidence that a pheromone gets released along with
      the eggs, which attracts even uninfected people to the host. This is stage one,
      and lasts no more than about five days. In stage <i>two</i>, things go downhill,
      while the sex drive gets even stronger. People start to lose verbal skills and
      go numb at the fingers and toes. This is because the parasite’s larvae feeds
      on the outer brain matter. It slowly begins to eat everything but the amygdalae.
      Meanwhile, the colony lays millions more eggs in the host’s reproductive organs.”
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris stood and lead us over to the opposite side of the dusty
      grain elevator engine. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Have a look at this.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A
      pair of bodies, each covered in a thick sheet, lay side by side on an old door
      supported by a pair of sawhorses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian said, “You don’t have to
      see this if you don’t want to.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by now, I didn’t care what
      I saw. I was feeling not just emotionally drained, but emotionally blank. I
      knew right now I could see anything without being affected by it. And I was
      also curious. Learning about the disease was helping me focus my thoughts, and,
      surprisingly, even calming me down a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m okay,” I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      Bryce had had enough. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sorry, I think I need to catch my breath,”
      he said, and he stepped outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris pushed back the sheet to
      partially expose one of the bodies. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d thought I could handle
      this, but I gagged when I saw what was lying on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      had only revealed the body’s torso and pelvic area. The face was still covered,
      but I could tell right away that it was Mr. Hershel. He had been cut into and
      opened up from his neck all the way down to his pelvis. I hadn’t ever seen human
      organs on display like that. The scent of wet offal rose from the cavity like
      heat. But that wasn’t the worst part. The penis was still erect, as stiff as
      the rest of the body. The testicles had blackened and swollen even further.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh my God.” I took a step back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris uncapped
      a scalpel from his breast pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Stage three is bad,” he said.
      “The host body starts to decay, movement becomes awkward, personality and memory
      fades, and people start to get, well, kinda <i>rapey</i>. Men generally maintain
      a perpetual erection. It’s the last chance for the parasite to pass its eggs
      to a new host, so the reproduction impulse goes into overdrive. At this point,
      in the case of male hosts,” Chris nodded at Mr. Hershel’s testicles, “the parasite
      has replaced all of the semen with its own eggs, suspended in a kind of honey—a
      little like bees’ honey—which the new larvae will feed on after hatching in
      the <i>new</i> host.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris carefully positioned the scalpel over
      one of Mr. Hershel’s bloated testicles. He carefully punctured the skin. Immediately,
      a viscous, yellow substance oozed from the puncture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He held a
      droplet on the tip of the scalpel blade, displaying it as well as possible in
      the granary’s dim light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If you were to taste it, it would taste
      a lot like honey,” he said, then he laughed. “Not that I recommend tasting it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right
      away I thought about Bryce coming in my mouth, and how I’d spit out his semen
      as an afterthought. But was I still at risk? What if Bryce was infected? What
      if I’d felt so attracted to him because he’d been releasing the pheromones Chris
      mentioned? After all, who, in a normal state of mind, would do anything so strange
      as to go down on someone inside a buried coffin?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How contagious
      is it?” I asked. “I mean, if you <i>did</i> taste it, say, would you get infected?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Probably
      not.” Chris shrugged casually. “Not as far as we know, anyway. The infection
      can only be passed through the genitalia. Only through vaginal sex. So, kids,
      always use protection!” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He gave me and Ian an ironic thumbs up.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Otherwise, you’ll end up like poor Mr. Hershel here.” Chris
      nodded at Mr. Hershel’s motionless body as he pulled the sheet back over it.
      “Or, even worse,” he added, “like <i>this</i> guy who you two found at the high
      school.” He slapped a hand down on what must have been the knee of the other
      covered body. “Poor guy cut off his own twizzler when he couldn’t stop thinking
      about forcing himself on cheerleaders.” He winced. “Didn’t help him any though.
      He finally expired and fell through that window above the showers. When the
      parasite’s life cycle completes, the colony dies, and the host expires too.
      But the only way to stop the process before a host’s natural expiration is to
      destroy the amygdalae. That’s why the Home Guard doesn’t have any qualms about
      shooting TGV positives in the head. They could keep them isolated until they
      expire naturally, but that’s too costly, and, according to them, too risky.
      An ice pick in the ear would be neater, but the rangers like their guns. That’s
      why they get away with it, though. Because TGV positives are technically already
      dead.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting aside Chris’s callousness, I was trying my best
      to understand. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“But how are they dead?” I asked. “I mean, I get
      that they’ve technically died, and that the parasite takes over the brain. But
      if a person is awake, and has the same personality, and memories, and thoughts,
      how is that any different than being alive? Especially in the first stages.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      shrugged. “It’s not any different. Not really. That’s why I defected from the
      hospital when the Home Guard took it over. That’s why I’m stuck hiding out in
      this fucking granary. I don’t see how it’s okay to go around whacking innocent
      people SS-style. Even if they <i>are</i> dead.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that Chris
      had finished his explanation, Ian touched my arm solemnly. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ash,
      I have to show you something,” he whispered. “I didn’t think you’d be ready
      for this, not after everything you’ve been through today, but now I’m thinking
      maybe you are.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I braced myself. I wasn’t actually so sure that
      I was ready for anything else today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian reached into his pocket
      and took out a white plastic applicator, just like the ones the Home Guard used
      to test for infection. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I know what that is,” I said. “I watched
      Jason using one.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Unfortunately, this was our only one,” Ian
      explained. “They’re hard to come by. They work by taking a urine sample.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      pressed a button, and a three-inch needle extended from the applicator with
      a click. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“They’re Insta-Reads,” he said. “Which means they’re
      designed to take a quick sample from the bladder by piercing the abdomen, in
      cases when someone refuses to give urine. But they work just as well by peeing
      on the needle. You don’t actually have to stab anyone.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He clicked
      the button again, and the needle withdrew. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This one is Morgan’s.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      handed me the applicator. He and Chris both waited silently for me to read it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just
      like a pregnancy test, there were simple instructions. One blue line meant “Stage
      1 TGV.” Two blues lines meant “Stage 2 TGV.” Three blue lines meant “Stage 3
      TGV.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan’s test had two blue lines. Stage 2 TGV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      had to have known, on some level, listening to Chris’s explanation about how
      the pathogen worked, that Morgan was infected. She’d been sleeping with Mr.
      Hershel for weeks even before he’d raped her. She’d gotten sick, and I’d watched
      her stop breathing and lie still without a heartbeat for at least fifteen minutes
      before waking back up. But I hadn’t really let myself accept it until now, seeing
      the brute fact of two blue lines on the applicator. And I hadn’t expected her
      to have reached the second stage so soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sometimes it progresses
      pretty quickly,” Chris said, condoling me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked back and the
      granary door. “She’s here, isn’t she? Somewhere?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ll take you
      to her now,” Ian said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I followed Ian and Chris outside. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      was sitting beside the granary, his back against the corrugated tin wall. He
      stood. I handed him the applicator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s Morgan’s.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      read it. He nodded slowly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris lit a cigarette, a Camel Light,
      as he led us all toward the second of the six round silos. He offered the cigarette
      to me, and after a moment I accepted it, taking a long, trembling drag before
      handing it back over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian took a few cautious steps toward the
      long row of silos, and somberly motioned for us to follow him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      whispered, “Before we go in, you should know that Chris has been trying to help
      Morgan. He’s been giving her a cocktail of antibiotics.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s
      still early,” Chris broke in. “So we really don’t know how well it works. But,
      for now, it seems to have some effect on slowing the progression of the disease.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This
      was good news. I needed good news. I had a little hope for Morgan. Maybe if
      there was a way to slow the disease, there was a way to cure it completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“But
      the cocktail’s a combination of some pretty powerful antibiotics,” Ian said.
      “It has some side effects. Morgan’s gotten pretty weak. Chris says it’ll probably
      get worse before it gets better. She’s also not sleeping because of the hallucinatory
      nightmares the antibiotics have been causing. She’s exhausted. And the kicker
      is we’re already running low on the antibiotics Chris needs to make the cocktail.
      Problem is, even as a medical officer I don’t have clearance at the pharmacy.
      They keep it pretty closely guarded. Jason is one of the only rangers in the
      Home Guard with an access card because the pharmacy falls in his squad’s residential
      patrol zone. And he’s not exactly going to do me any favors, not after today.
      I can’t even order him to give it over because I don’t outrank him in that way.
      And if I ever tried to just take it from him, his squad would back him up.”
      Ian gave me a stern look. “Look, Ash. I’m telling you all this so you know why
      Morgan’s in the state she’s in. But I don’t want you to get your hopes up. We’re
      doing all we can, there’s just not much more we can do for her. Our hands are
      pretty tied.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I nodded. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I understand,” I said.
      “Just let me see her.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian took a key from his pocket and stepped
      toward the silo door. I hadn’t realized it was locked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You locked
      her <i>in</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It wasn’t our idea,” Ian said. “She made us <i>promise</i>
      to lock her in. She was terrified of what she’d do as the disease progressed.
      She was worried she would leave.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian pushed the door open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      she was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan was sitting on the concrete floor beside a little
      kerosene lantern, unlit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She smiled at me sadly. She raised her
      hand to motion for me to sit beside her, but she was obviously weak. She struggled
      to hold her arms out to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sat beside her and hugged her for
      a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What the hell, kid?” I said, holding back my tears.
      “We’re going to get you better.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan shrugged and nodded without
      much hope. She wasn’t saying anything. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>She couldn’t speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      knew that she was going to be in a bad state, but I hadn’t fully prepared myself
      for her to have completely lost the ability to talk to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She
      grabbed my shoulder, pointed toward the ground, and gave me a sad, terrified
      look. Then she hugged me again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I told her what happened to you
      the other day,” Ian said. “In the coffin.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I understood. I hugged
      Morgan back. “Thanks, kid.” I said. “I’m okay now.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan tried
      to tell me something else. She pointed at me and Bryce. When she couldn’t express
      herself by pointing, she tried to speak, but only hollow gibberish came out
      of her mouth. It was like her lips were numb, and her jaw seemed stiff. She
      couldn’t form words or sounds at all. She started to cry in frustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’ll
      get you something to write with,” I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan gave me yet another
      look of despair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian said, “Writing’s not so easy for her either.
      We tried that. Her fingers are getting pretty numb.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan turned
      away and slammed her hand against the tin wall. The loud bang resonated in the
      silo’s confined space. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>She started to cry miserably, still without
      making any sound. I moved closer to her and held her while she cried. She started
      to rock herself back and forth, and I let myself rock with her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then,
      slowly, Morgan started to breathe more deeply. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>She turned her
      head so her lips were against my ear, and I could feel the warmth of her suddenly
      tense inhalations. She moved her leg just a little over mine. Then she pressed
      her pubic bone into my hip, rotating her pelvis. She let out a soft little moan
      of something close to pleasure. It was the first fully-formed sound I’d heard
      her make. Then she started grinding even harder into my hip. She gently bit
      my ear lobe, breathing even more deeply and moaning again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She
      was trying to get off on me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Morgan,” I said. I pushed her away
      as gently as I could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian stepped over and helped me up, pushing
      Morgan back as he separated us. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As if waking from a trance, Morgan
      suddenly realized what she’d been doing. She looked mortified. Suddenly she
      slammed the tin wall again, curled up into a little ball with her head between
      her knees, and started sobbing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian pulled me farther away from
      her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“She can’t help it,” he reminded me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      looked up. She waved us away, tears spilling from her eyes, then made a locking
      motion at Ian, reminding him to make sure to lock her inside. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      all stepped out. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was nothing else I could do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was getting late. The sun was setting over the mountains. I felt completely
      hopeless. For a moment, I didn’t see the point of going on living. What were
      we all going to do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian quietly closed the door and locked the
      padlock. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That’s the thing about this disease,” he said. “It
      takes any outpouring of emotion, even sorrow, and turns it into sexual attraction.
      Not just love and affection, like normal, but anger, gratitude, humor—everything.
      It all comes out as lust.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce and Chris walked on ahead. I
      wasn’t sure, but I think Chris may have been hooking Bryce up with some weed
      in the middle of all this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We better get going,” Ian said. “I
      registered your official residence at your parents’ house, so you’ll be able
      to stay there. It falls in the residential patrol zone that Jason’s squad has,
      though. I couldn’t do anything about that. They usually arrive at the house
      around noon. Your mom’s even been making them lunch. But, really, they could
      come at any time. If you’re not there, they’ll put your warrant back out, and
      I won’t be able to stop them. Morgan, obviously, has to stay here.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      nodded. “We better get going then,” I said. “But first tell me something.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      folded his arms against the evening chill, waiting for me to speak. Way off
      in the distance, the Rockies were growing darker. The first stars were appearing
      in the sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve just had this feeling,” I said. “I’m sorry to
      ask. I shouldn’t. I know. But did anything ever happen between you and Morgan?
      Ever?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian sighed. For a moment he looked away. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That
      night at the bar,” he began, “after you and Bryce left, we went off looking
      for you together. I’ll be honest and tell you that Morgan came on to me. She
      tried to kiss me, but that was it. She was pretty drunk. I stopped it. Nothing
      else happened.” He shrugged. “I swear, that was it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I nodded,
      relieved. I knew he was telling the truth. And I felt awful for Morgan. It was
      true she slept around, but I knew under normal circumstances she wouldn’t ever
      have come on to my brother-in-law. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought about my best friend
      alone in that silo, and how she was selflessly insisting to be locked in, just
      to protect other people. I would have done anything to help her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then
      I thought of a way that maybe I could do something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I turned back
      to Ian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You said Jason and Shawn and those guys have lunch at
      the house, right?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yeah.” Ian shook his head, annoyed that my
      mom was being so hospitable. “Your mom’s keeping them well fed while they’re
      on patrol.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And Jason’s the only one you know of who has a pharmacy
      access card?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, yeah.” Ian looked at me warily. “Why?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Because
      I think I could get it from him.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was surprised at my suggestion.
      “Ashley, <i>I</i> couldn’t even get it from him. He has his whole squad to back
      him up.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“But what if he didn’t? What if I got him alone? He’s
      been coming on to me non-stop since the fair. And I’m pretty sure I could get
      him drunk, or high on those pills of his. If I could talk to him alone for even
      just a minute at the house, I could set something up with him to meet somewhere.
      I’m sure I could get him to agree if he thought I wanted to sleep with him.
      It’s worth a try, right?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No <i>way</i>.” Ian shook his head
      emphatically. “That’s way to dangerous. You alone with that psycho? Come on.
      Ashley, no way.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What other way is there?” I asked. “You said
      yourself you can’t get the pharmacy access card from him, right?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      didn’t respond, but he gave me a look of frustrated helplessness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well
      then?” I said, trying to keep my voice low so Bryce and Chris wouldn’t hear
      me. “What’s the other option? You don’t have enough antibiotics to keep Morgan
      stable. What’s <i>your</i> plan? Just do nothing and let her progress to stage
      three?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley, come on.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Give me a better plan.”
      I stepped in front him, forcing Ian to stop walking back to the granary and
      listen to me. “Give me a better plan, and I won’t do this,” I said. “Otherwise
      I’m getting Jason alone tomorrow and making him think I want to fuck him. I
      can get his access card. I know I can. I can do this.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian didn’t
      say anything. He waved goodbye to Chris and walked me and Bryce back to my parent's
      house along the river. He didn’t agree one way or another to my plan. But as
      we made our way through the growing darkness, I could tell he knew I was right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      wasn’t any other way.</p>\r\n</div>"

    - "<div class=\"blog_text\"><p>Part 4 is finally finished! I had so much fun writing
      about the transformation of Ashley’s town and all the changes in her life. Some
      crazy stuff happens during her escape, and a lot of details about the plague
      are explained. Ashley has some big decisions to make about her role in forming
      a resistance movement against the Home Guard, and in Part 5 her choices are
      going to play out in some pretty unexpected ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to report
      that Kyle finally got back to me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was feeling more and more
      sick to my stomach with every hour that passed when he wasn’t responding to
      my text, but then I got a long email from him, totally unexpectedly. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      actually apologized for getting <i>me</i> in trouble. Then he wrote about how
      what happened between us really meant a lot to him. He said he was sorry that
      he’d been out of touch for a while, and that I’d just taken him by surprise
      in the car. He told me he wanted me to be a part of his life, and that he wanted
      to see me again. I felt SO much better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I told him that I
      wanted to see him again, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, that won’t exactly be
      easy. My dad’s really been keeping an eye on me lately, especially after he
      caught Kyle parked outside our house. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in his last email,
      Kyle asked me if I thought I could sneak out again. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I probably
      shouldn’t, but I think I’m going to. I haven’t decided for sure yet. But I really
      want to. I <i>really</i> want to see him again. Even if my dad catches me, I
      think it’ll be worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>. . . What do you think I should do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway,
      in the meantime, I’m already starting to plan out Part 5. A lot of exciting
      ideas came to me when I was taking pictures of dripping honey for the cover
      image for Part 4. Much more to come soon! Tweet or message @BaileySimms if you
      want to get in touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">xxBailey</p>\r\n</div>"

    - "<div class=\"novel_text\"><p><span class=\"first_letter\">M</span>y mom wouldn’t
      stop knitting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I came in through the door, she said, “So
      you’ve decided to grace us with your presence.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She refused to
      look up from the scarf she was making for Haley. It had grown by an arm’s length
      in the days I’d been gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All I’d wanted was to come home to
      my parents’ house, spend a semi-normal evening with my family, maybe have one
      of my mom’s home-cooked meals, then actually sleep in a bed. I really needed
      some sanity after everything I’d been through. And considering that I was going
      to try to seduce and drug Jason Gibbs tomorrow, I was hoping to get some rest
      so I could prepare. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But apparently Shawn and the rest of Jason’s
      squad had told my family that I was wanted for hiding infected refugees. They
      all thought that I’d been gone because I’d been with Morgan somewhere, concealing
      her from the Home Guard. I thought about telling them what had actually happened,
      but how could I? I didn’t think anyone would really believe that I’d been buried
      alive then locked in a stripped-down U-Haul for the better part of a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      don’t see why you don’t just tell them where Morgan is,” my mom scolded. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      hadn’t realized that she was in such deep denial about everything that was happening.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“They know what’s best for her,” she went on, fiercely knitting
      at the kitchen counter while she lectured me. “They’re keeping us all safe.
      I don’t know why you have to go and disrupt all of that. They’re all such nice
      boys. And Shawn! You should be so proud of him! This has been so <i>good</i>
      for him. You need to be more grateful. We’re all just so lucky that the good
      guys are on our side, watching out for us.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’d missed dinner.
      Ian was having a beer with Bryce on the porch, and I’d told them that I’d make
      up some sandwiches. My dad was washing the dishes. As I opened the fridge, he
      dried his hands and put an arm around me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s good to see you,”
      he said, softly, so my mom wouldn’t hear him. “I was worried. I’m glad you’re
      home.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the dining table, Danielle was playing cards with Tyler
      and Haley. My sister hadn’t said a word to me since I’d arrived at the house.
      When I went to grab the bread knife from the table, she scowled. She stood up,
      placing herself between me and her children, then she whispered fiercely into
      my ear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I know you know where that little bitch is,” she hissed.
      “She’s probably the one who brought that disease in from outside. You need to
      tell Ian where she is. No more fucking around, Ashley.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hadn’t
      realized how much Ian wasn’t telling Danielle. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>She didn’t have
      a clue about what was going on. He obviously didn’t trust her to keep the granary
      a secret. And judging by how my sister was acting now, he was absolutely right
      not to trust her. She wasn’t ever the most easy-going of the two of us, but
      I’d never seen her behave this way. The stress was really getting to her, I
      could tell. Suddenly, it seemed, she hated me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Play with us,
      Aunt Ashley!” Haley peeked around her mother and looked at me expectantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even
      after all I’d been through, I felt really bad having to say no to my niece yet
      again. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Next time,” I told her, mussing her hair. “I’ve got some
      important things to take care of. And we have a guest,” I said, nodding in the
      direction of the porch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler couldn’t have heard what his mother
      whispered into my ear, but he looked at both of us apprehensively. He was still
      in that awkward stage; he was probably going to be good looking when he got
      out of adolescence, but his nose had suddenly gotten too big for his face, and
      his forehead was ringed with acne from wearing his football helmet. Poor kid.
      He just wanted life to be normal, to play football, and to meet girls his age.
      He’d been helping Haley fan out the cards in her hand, and I could tell right
      away that he was terrified at everything that was happening, even though he
      was putting on a good face and trying to help his little sister through it.
      I think he just wanted everyone to stick together and make it out alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Let’s
      just leave Aunt Ashley alone for a little while,” he said graciously, avoiding
      Danielle’s gaze. “She’s probably starving.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was right. I was
      famished. Other than the military rations that the Home Guard had delivered
      to the house, my parents seemed only to have an endless supply of freezer-burnt
      roast beef and white bread. While I made a sandwich each for Ian, Bryce, and
      myself, I ate at least another sandwich’s worth of the meat with my fingers.
      I still had a strange, insatiable craving for a hamburger and a milkshake, but
      instead I poured a big glass of milk and gulped it down. I hadn’t craved milk
      like this since I was a kid, but I couldn’t get enough of it. I poured a second
      glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I brought Ian and Bryce their sandwiches. They thanked
      me effusively. Both of them looked guilty that they hadn’t helped me while they’d
      sat on the porch with beers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But completing these little tasks
      kept my mind occupied. It prevented me from collapsing in a heap and totally
      breaking down, which I was afraid I might do now that I was relatively safe
      at the house. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Shawn was only a private, he had to bunk
      at the Home Guard Center, and the couch was free. I put sheets on the cushions
      for Bryce and laid out a blanket. I made myself another sandwich and took it
      upstairs to my old bedroom. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internet had been shut down.
      When I tried to log on, the only accessible site was homeguard.gov, which automatically
      appeared after I opened the browser. The site had maps of each residential district,
      a ration distribution schedule, and an emergency hotline for “reporting individuals
      suspected of being infected with the TGV pathogen.” In big, red letters running
      across the top of the screen, it warned, “IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      same thing happened when I tried to use the internet on my phone. The Home Guard
      website immediately appeared, and I couldn’t access any other page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      showered. I put on a pair of threadbare sweats that I’d long ago discarded.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t believe how much weight I’d lost. I studied myself
      in the mirror for the first time in days. My cheeks had hollowed out, and I
      could actually see the contours of my abdominal muscles. I hadn’t looked like
      this since I was fourteen. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good, I thought. I was looking hot,
      actually. All the better for tempting Jason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I brushed my teeth
      and got into bed without saying goodnight to anyone. I fell asleep going over
      all the things I could say to Jason to make him believe I actually wanted to
      sleep with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">S</span>ometime
      late at night, Bryce came into my room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He closed the door softly,
      then he sat at the edge of my bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley,” he whispered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d
      been in a deep sleep, and I tried not to be too annoyed that he’d woken me.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I said, “If you’re looking for a late-night Lady Gaga dance party,
      sorry, but I’m little worn out.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He laughed quietly. “I guess
      I’ll go ask your mom if she’s down then.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I smiled at the thought.
      “You’d probably have better luck with my dad.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hadn’t moved
      since Bryce had sat on my bed. I closed my eyes. I could feel his weight on
      my mattress. For a while he just sat there in the dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally
      I asked, “What’s up?” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The night was completely quiet. There was
      no wind. There were no crickets. Just a deep, dark silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      just can’t stop thinking about it,” Bryce whispered. “When they locked us up
      in those U-Hauls, I kept dreaming we were back in the coffin. And when I woke
      up, it was so dark I thought maybe I really was in the coffin again. I kept
      spreading out my arms, trying to convince myself I was only in the back of a
      van.” He drew in a deep breath. I think he’d started to cry a little, but he
      was holding it back. “God, I really thought I was going to die in that fucking
      thing.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he stopped talking, the night’s silence rushed back
      in. It was almost like we were alone together in the coffin again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      thought I was going to die in there too,” I whispered. What else could I say?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      sensed Bryce turning to look at me. I could just make out his profile. It seemed
      like he wanted to say more but couldn’t find the right words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      felt myself start to nod off again. I was exhausted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m really
      tired.” I reached out and touched his knee for a moment, then I pulled my hand
      back under my covers. “I have a big day tomorrow.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Right,” Bryce
      said. “Sorry.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stood and stepped softly from the room. I heard
      him making his way quietly back down the stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now that
      he’d left, I couldn’t sleep. I started regretting making him leave. I <i>did</i>
      want to talk about what we’d gone through together, at some point. I knew that
      no one else in the world would ever be able to understand what it was like to
      be trapped beneath the earth. No one else would ever be able to understand what
      we’d shared down there. No one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to go back to sleep. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried not to think about Bryce, or how alone I’d started to feel. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead,
      I thought about Morgan. But that only made things worse. I missed talking to
      her so much. I just wanted to call her on the phone like I’d normally do if
      I was feeling shitty, but I couldn’t. It was hard to bear the idea that maybe
      I’d never be able to talk to her again. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt even more alone
      than before. It was like I was a tiny speck of dust floating out in the frozen,
      starry universe. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment I thought about waking Ian and
      talking to him, but I couldn’t. It would be weird. Right now he was fast asleep
      in bed with Danielle, quietly keeping all of his secrets from her. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      lay awake for an hour, maybe two. I couldn’t go back to sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">J</span>ust before dawn, I crept downstairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      could tell right away that Bryce wasn’t asleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I lay down on
      the couch beside him and pulled the sheet over us both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      wrapped his arms around me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started to cry. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      couldn’t help it. I just sobbed for a few minutes while he held on to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s
      okay,” he whispered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, then, we were kissing. I wasn’t sure
      if I’d kissed him, or if he’d kissed me. We were just kissing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon,
      somehow, I was on top of him. I took his shirt off and stripped my own shirt
      off as quickly as I could. I couldn’t think of anything but being as close to
      him as physically possible. I felt his bare chest against my breasts, and I
      put my arms around his neck. I pressed my body into his with all my weight.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very suddenly, but quietly, he flipped us both over so that I
      was on my back. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He lay between my legs. He was still wearing
      jeans, but I could feel through my threadbare sweats how hard he was when he
      pressed into me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I unbuckled his belt. As soon as I started doing
      this, he tore off my sweats and underwear all at once. I couldn’t believe how
      wet I was. I unzipped his pants, reached into his underwear, and—I couldn’t
      help it—I pulled him straight inside me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought maybe I was
      really falling in love with him. Ever since we’d been trapped alone together
      inside the coffin, Bryce and I had been linked together. Neither of us would
      ever see our lives in the same way afterwards, and only the two of us could
      really understand what that meant. My marriage with Shawn was obviously over.
      A future inside the Muldoon quarantine zone, living amid a devastating plague,
      wasn’t much of a future, but it was the only future any of us had. Maybe Bryce
      and I could share it together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as I pulled him inside
      me, he pressed even deeper in. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sex I had with him that early
      morning was like nothing I’d ever experienced. I knew there was some chance
      that he could be infected, and that I was responding to the pathogen’s pheromones.
      But what I felt for him felt so <i>real</i>, and so human. Bryce was staggeringly
      tender with me, and yet so irresistibly firm at the same time. He whispered
      how he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about me while we were locked away
      from one another, then he grabbed my pelvis and pushed so deep inside me I thought
      I was going to explode with pleasure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started to come, and
      it was all I could do to keep from yelling out and waking everybody up. Bryce
      put his hand over my mouth and I bit into his finger, which only made him drive
      deeper inside me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just before he came, that self-preserving
      part of me rose back up in my consciousness, and I pulled away from him. I grabbed
      his penis in both of my hands as he cried out, arching his back, and I felt
      his warm semen leap onto my belly and breasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce heaved a
      huge sigh, collapsed beside me, cradled my head in his arms, and kissed my forehead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      whispered something. “You and me,” he said. “We’re going to stick together.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      kissed him softly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was so hard not to just fall asleep in his
      arms. I hadn’t felt such warm, satisfied peace since long before the plague.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the morning sky was growing brighter. The sun was already
      about to rise. My family would be up soon. I had to get back to my bedroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      grabbed a tissue from the box on the side table. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was just
      at that most vulnerable of moments, as I was wiping Bryce’s semen from my belly,
      that I saw someone standing in the living room window.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>t was a woman. And at her hip was
      a young boy, maybe two years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was about my age. The first
      rays of morning sunlight were coming over the plains, illuminating one side
      of her face and her freshly-straightened hair. She was beautiful, like she belonged
      on a TV show. And she was staring right at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was completely
      naked. Bryce, asleep, had collapsed on one of my legs. His head rested on my
      breast. Morning sunlight was falling on his bare ass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman
      screamed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me!” she yelled through
      the window. “Are you <i>kidding</i> me?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She stomped across the
      porch and threw open the front door, oblivious that anyone was asleep in the
      house. Or she just didn’t care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce looked at her, groaned,
      then let his face fall onto the sofa pillow. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman stormed
      toward us. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Seriously?!</i>” she screamed, even louder than
      before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boy in her arms looked like he was on the verge of
      crying, but his face was frozen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I scrambled to wrap the sheet
      around my shoulders, which left Bryce uncovered. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He tugged on
      his pants, taking his time to zip them. He left his belt unfastened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Lindsay,”
      was all he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman was wearing a wedding band and a huge
      engagement ring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it was my turn to yell at Bryce. “Are you
      kidding <i>me</i>?” I screamed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone in the house had to be
      up by now anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce looked at me, defeated. He shrugged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yeah,”
      the woman yelled at me. “I’m his wife. He’s fucking married. With—” she gestured
      silently at the boy in her arms, obviously Bryce’s son. She smiled acerbically.
      “Surprised? I fucking bet.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Lindsay,” Bryce repeated. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was like he was capable only of repeating his wife’s name. He just sat back
      in the couch, shirtless, with a surprisingly unapologetic expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      came all the way out here looking for you,” Lindsay screamed, nodding indignantly.
      “And then they tell me I can’t <i>leave</i> <i>town</i>? I spend a week in a
      shitty motel, finally track you down, thinking these fucking Nazi Robocop’s
      are after you, and here you are with—” she shook her head, finally whispering
      as she pointed at me, “<i>her</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The phones were down.” Bryce
      stared at his wife with a strange confidence. “I tried to call. I couldn’t.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lindsay
      just stared at him, speechless, shocked at this response. Finally his son started
      to cry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce looked slowly from Lindsay to me. Again, he just
      shrugged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I slapped him. I slapped him really hard. I cuffed him
      across the jaw with the full weight of my arm. I couldn’t believe how he was
      acting. I didn’t even recognize him as the Bryce I’d known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For
      a brief moment he looked at me with an expression of shame and contrition. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      just—” he began, but he couldn’t complete his sentence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly,
      I understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I backed away from him instinctively, horrified,
      gathering the sheet around my body. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Bryce had tried to speak,
      but couldn’t, he’d made this quivering jerk of the jaw that was <i>just like
      what Morgan did</i> when she’d tried to speak in the silo. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      was infected. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no doubt. He’d been so charmingly talkative
      before we’d gotten trapped in the coffin. But ever since then, he’d hardly said
      anything. I’d thought that it was because of the trauma he’d gone through, but
      I’d been wrong. Bryce had been speaking in shorter and shorter sentences, until
      finally this morning he’d gone into this strange, sexually-charged state of
      speaking only in very terse phrases. He wasn’t just infected. He was moving
      into stage two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even as I grew more angry, and more heartbroken,
      I felt a sudden, intense urge to fuck him again. What was I thinking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was still holding the tissue I’d used to wipe his semen. I held it to my nose.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It smelled like honey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That night?” I asked him.
      “In the hay loft?” I was crying now. “You <i>slept with </i>Morgan that night?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      stared straight into my eyes. “Couldn’t help it.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somehow everything
      he said when he spoke this way sounded so<i> reasonable</i> and <i>forgivable</i>,
      even when it obviously wasn’t. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It had to be the effect the pheromones
      were having on me. And his beautiful blue eyes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually felt
      a little tingling between my legs again. My pulse picked up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      was happening? It was like a spell. I was dizzy. . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I forced
      my thoughts away from thinking about sex with Bryce. It was surprising how difficult
      it was, until finally I remembered what he’d done to me, and I snapped out of
      it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You slept with Morgan,” I said. “And you didn’t <i>tell</i>
      me about it, and then you slept with <i>me</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Couldn’t help
      it,” he repeated, again as if this was the most reasonable response in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      felt another wave of pheromone-induced dizziness in which I wanted to kiss him
      and slap him all at once. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce just sat there on the couch staring
      unapologetically at his wife, his baby son, and at me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sad
      thing was that when he said he<i> couldn’t help it</i>, he’d been telling the
      truth, in a way. The pathogen was affecting his consciousness. It was making
      him want to have sex with as many partners as possible in the shortest amount
      of time, no matter the cost. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet my feelings for him had
      felt so <i>real</i>. I’d even thought a few hours ago that maybe I was falling
      in love with him. Was that just the effect of the pheromones too? How could
      I know for sure? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I backed away from Bryce, trying to distance
      myself from whatever strange effect his physical presence was having on my body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As
      soon as I was more than a few feet away, my feelings changed. Suddenly, it seemed
      absolutely crazy that I’d had sex with him on the living room couch. My family
      <i>must</i> have heard us. What had I been thinking? I tried to remember the
      moment when Bryce came. Thank God I’d pulled away. But had I pulled away in
      time? Had some of his semen ended up inside me? I didn’t <i>think </i>so, but
      I couldn’t be sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was only now that I realized my entire
      family—all of them—was watching from the kitchen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Tyler and
      Haley had appeared, but Danielle was busy trying to pull them away from the
      scene we were causing in the living room. My mom was speechlessly shaking her
      head, both at me and at the strange woman who had barged into her house with
      a toddler. My dad was averting his eyes. Ian was pacing around the kitchen,
      trying to decide whether or not to intervene. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled the sheet
      more closely around my shoulders. Underneath, I was wearing nothing. I had no
      choice but to gather up my clothes and hurry away to the bathroom, horrified
      at what had I’d done.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">A</span>fter
      I washed up and dressed, I sat on the front porch steps. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t
      face anyone. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not yet anyway. I’d never felt so mortified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d
      lost control of myself with Bryce, my entire family knew I was cheating on my
      husband, and now I couldn’t even be sure whether I was infected because I had
      no way of testing myself—Chris and Ian had used their last test applicator on
      Morgan. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone opened the front door behind me. The screen door
      banged shut. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still wasn’t ready to see anyone. I was slightly
      hoping the person approaching would turn out to be Ian, but I wasn’t sure if
      I felt like speaking even to him. I was so embarrassed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Your
      mom wanted me to give you this.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn’t Ian. It was the last
      person I expected it to be. It was Bryce’s wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lindsay sat beside
      me and handed me a cup of coffee. I took it tentatively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Look,”
      she said. “I’m sorry I barged in on all you guys.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was really
      strikingly attractive. Dark blue eyes, dark hair, sharp features, a perfect
      body. Perfect everything. Why would Bryce have shown any interest in me, with
      a wife like this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’re apologizing to <i>me</i>?” I asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was ready for the woman to tear me to pieces, now that she had me alone, but
      she didn’t even seem angry. She actually sounded like she felt sorry for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,
      yeah,” she said. She didn’t have her son with her. My mom must have had him
      inside. “I just came into a house full of total strangers, screaming and yelling
      like that. I’m lucky I didn’t get shot.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>I’m</i> sorry,” I
      said. I imagined what Lindsay must have seen through the window: her husband
      sprawled out naked with a strange girl. “I’m so, <i>so</i> sorry. Bryce didn’t
      say <i>anything</i> about being married.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“He never does.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lindsay
      blew on her steaming coffee, wrapping her hands around the mug. It was a cold
      morning. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This isn’t exactly the first time,” she said. “I can
      only blame myself for staying with him as long as I have. After I got pregnant,
      his last girlfriend tried to warn me about him. I didn’t listen, but she was
      right. He’s just an egotistical asshole. He always will be.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      thing was, though, Bryce didn’t <i>seem</i> like an asshole. It was true that
      he didn’t tell me about his wife and son, which, I had to admit, was an extremely
      asshole-ish thing to do. But he <i>seemed</i> so kind. He hadn’t ever come off
      as egocentric. He was charming, but in a really sweet way. Was it because of
      the pathogen that he’d behaved so irresistibly charmingly? If so, that meant
      he’d been infected even before sleeping with Morgan. Had he been in stage one
      when I’d first met him . . . ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone else came out onto the
      porch. The screen door slammed shut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Bryce. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      sat on the porch swing behind us. He was still wearing nothing but jeans. He
      clasped his hands behind his head. He had a really amazing body. Even the way
      he planted his bare feet against the porch boards was cute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m
      sorry,” he said. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn’t sure whether he was apologizing to
      me or to Lindsay. It looked like he wanted to say something more, but his jaw
      only made the same quivering jerk as before, and he gave up trying to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What
      are you sorry for, Bryce?” Lindsay was already seething again. “Are you sorry
      for sleeping around? Again?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I realized she had no idea that Bryce
      was infected. I wondered if that’s what he’d been trying to tell her when he
      hadn’t been able to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Don’t be sorry for sleeping around,”
      she said. “Okay? Sleep around all you fucking want. Because it’s over between
      us. Got it? Over. You want to be sorry about something? Be sorry that your wife—your
      <i>ex</i>-wife—came to look for you, with your <i>son</i>, after you disappeared.
      And then I got stuck in this shit-hole town for who knows how long. <i>Forever</i>,
      for all I know. Be sorry for <i>that</i>. Don’t be sorry for sleeping with Ashley,
      or whoever else you fucking want.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What the <i>hell</i> is going
      on here?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My attention had been focused so intensely on Lindsay
      and Bryce that I hadn’t noticed that someone was coming up the driveway behind
      me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Shawn. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wasn’t wearing his Home Guard
      combat gear. He was in his old street clothes. At his hip, though, was a very
      large handgun. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And he’d just heard everything Lindsay had said
      about Bryce sleeping with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What are you doing here?” I asked
      Shawn in a panic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Breakfast!” Shawn said, glancing from person
      to person on the porch. “Your mom’s making me <i>breakfast</i>. It’s my morning
      off. She didn’t tell you?” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My husband looked hurt and confused
      as he tried to make sense of Bryce Tripp sitting shirtless on the porch swing.
      I could tell he was struggling to process everything he’d just overheard Lindsay
      say. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce stood and held up his hands defensively. “We’re all
      just le-le—” he stuttered. But he couldn’t finish his sentence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What
      the <i>hell</i> is going on here?” Shawn repeated, now shooting me a mystified
      look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stormed up the porch. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He slipped his gun
      from the holster, then stared at Bryce as he tried to say something. But once
      again Bryce failed to get the words out, his jaw quivering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This
      is bullshit!” Shawn screamed like a distraught child. “You’re <i>all</i> obviously
      at risk!” He turned to me, disgusted. “Especially <i>you</i>! You fucking slut!”
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian rushed out to the porch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shawn,” he said.
      “Let’s just calm down a bit. You’re upset. I understand that. But let’s just
      calm down.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Calm down? What the fuck, Ian? I’m doing my job.
      This overrides <i>any</i> clearance you got! They’re <i>no doubt </i>a ‘contagion
      threat’ now!” Shawn wagged his gun between me and Bryce. “That means it’s up
      to our discretion to expire them or arrest them. Period! And this fucktard is
      well on his way to stage two!” He raised his gun and pointed it straight at
      Bryce. “What were you thinking, Ian? Keeping them at the house? I should have
      done this a <i>long</i> fucking time ago.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I leaped onto my feet
      and put a hand gingerly on Shawn’s shoulder. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shawn,” I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      whipped around, facing me. Tears were starting to well in his eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fuck
      you, Ashley,” he whispered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shawn.” I didn’t know what else to
      say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally he gave me a heartbreaking expression of hurt. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then
      he spun back around, and with a terrifying, primitive scream, he fired his gun
      at Bryce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian lunged forward, drawing his own gun now. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      he was too late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce collapsed backward onto the porch swing,
      sending the chains bouncing and jangling as he rolled to the ground. He clutched
      at his stomach, writhing in pain. Blood spilled between his fingers. For a moment
      he tried to pull himself up with his arms, smearing the porch boards with blood,
      but then he collapsed backward again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t believe how much
      blood had already gathered around Bryce. It had collected in a wide pool and
      was dripping off the porch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian held his gun firmly trained at
      Shawn’s head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You haven’t tested anyone, Shawn,” he said. “You’re
      not following protocol. Put your gun down. Stop right now.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn
      didn’t put his gun down. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, he pointed it directly at<i>
      my</i> face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“New rules.” Shawn’s gun was inches from my forehead.
      “Where have you been, Ian? We’re out of Insta-Reads. Until the next shipment
      comes in, it’s up to our <i>discretion to expire or arrest</i>.” He repeated
      this phrase like he was reading it from a manual, never taking the gun from
      my face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A deafening boom. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone had fired their
      gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It couldn’t have been Shawn, because when I opened my eyes
      I was still standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My husband was clutching his right hand.
      He was no longer holding his gun. Ian had shot it from his hand, puncturing
      his palm in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn screamed out in surprise and pain,
      staring hatefully at Ian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Do <i>not</i> point a gun at Ashley,”
      Ian said flatly, keeping his own gun pointed at Shawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard
      my mom screaming from inside the living room as she banged open the screen door
      and hurried toward Shawn, shrieking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“He wasn’t going to <i>shoot</i>
      her, Ian!” She completely ignored Bryce and tried to wrap a dishcloth around
      Shawn’s bleeding hand. “He was just doing his <i>job</i>. Somebody has to do
      their <i>job </i>around here!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My mom seemed to be losing her
      mind. Shawn just let her wrap his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You want a warrant?”
      Shawn yelled at Ian, staggering in pain toward his truck. “You stay right fucking
      here. You all stay <i>right fucking on these premises</i>!” he yelled. “There’s
      no <i>doubt</i> I’ll get a warrant for him and Ashley both after what I’ve seen
      here.” Shawn jerked his head toward Bryce, who was gasping and clutching at
      his stomach. “He’ll live,” he said. “That stomach wound won’t do anything. When
      I come back with the squad, we’re taking both of them in.” He looked at Lindsay,
      bent over Bryce, her knees soaking with his blood. “And <i>you</i> too!” he
      screamed. “Nobody cleared you to leave the motel!” Now he turned to Ian. “And
      <i>you</i> most of all! Shooting a Home Guard soldier? Are you crazy? You can
      kiss your cushy rank goodbye, son. Say hello to a fucking court marshal. Just
      wait. Just fucking wait! <i>Nobody</i> leave these premises!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawn
      jerked away from my mom, who was still trying to tie the dishcloth, and he hobbled
      into his truck. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He sped away in a storm of dust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      said, “We have to go. Now. All of us.”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">B</span>etween
      Ian, myself, and Lindsay, we were able to lift Bryce into my dad’s wheelbarrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      looked hopelessly uncomfortable splayed out inside. His legs dangled over the
      edge and his neck was bent to one side like a dead pig. But there was no other
      way to move him. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We have to leave, right now,” Ian said. “Jason’s
      squad could be here any minute. Shawn’s probably already called them. None of
      us are safe here anymore.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We scrambled down to the river and
      started making our way along the bank toward the granary. Ian pushed the wheelbarrow
      as carefully as he could, but Bryce’s head kept bouncing around inside. He was
      still conscious, but he’d lost so much blood he’d grown gruesomely pale. Lindsay
      had grabbed her son, and she struggled to carry the toddler as she hurried to
      keep up with us. She was covered in Bryce’s blood. The kid wouldn’t stop wailing.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was terrified that the crying was going to give up where we
      were. If Jason’s squad showed up right now, they’d hear the kid and come straight
      to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I grabbed him from Lindsay’s arms. She must have been in
      a state of shock, because she just let me take him. I put my hand over his mouth,
      careful not to cover his nostrils. And I just kept running. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All
      I could think about was getting inside the granary where we couldn’t be seen.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We left the bank and rounded the row of silos. But instead of
      an empty, weed-strewn grain yard like I’d expected to see, there was a group
      of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe seven or eight of them. They looked like they
      were waiting for something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all stopped, breathless. I realized
      the kid had stopped crying and I let go of his mouth. Ian put the wheelbarrow
      handles down and tried to catch his breath while he took in the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      recognized the Botteroffs, who lived on the other side of the Hershel’s. And
      my third grade teacher, Nancy Thomas, was sitting against the rusted tin wall.
      I didn’t recognize anyone else; they all must have been from out of town. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      were they doing here, at the granary? I didn’t understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Is
      this the Underground?” one man asked Ian. He was dressed in a mechanic’s jump
      suit, covered in grease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The what?” Ian lifted the wheelbarrow
      and started making his way warily through the small crowd toward the granary
      door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Underground,” an elderly woman said. “You do shelter
      positives, don’t you? From the Home Guard?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fuck,” Ian said under
      his breath. “Well, I guess we fucking do now. . .” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian tapped
      on the granary’s wall. “Chris! What’s going on out here, man! Who are these
      people?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris appeared at the door. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He looked
      around at the desperate faces. “Shit. There’s more?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What have
      you been telling people?” Ian demanded, rolling Bryce into the granary’s dark
      interior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I haven’t said anything!” Chris said. “You think I
      can treat any of them? <i>Any</i> of them? They just keep showing up!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’ll
      just have to hide them all in one of the silos for now,” Ian said, flustered.
      “Tell them not to make a sound. Home Guard will probably be crawling all over
      the place soon.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris looked more closely at Bryce. “What happened
      to him . . . ? He’s positive, isn’t he?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“He got shot, that’s
      what happened,” Ian said. “And, yes. He’s positive.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I <i>knew</i>
      it,” Chris said. “I <i>thought</i> something was up with that guy.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just
      get those people out of sight before someone shows up!” Ian said, hoisting Bryce
      from the wheelbarrow and laying him onto the granary’s dusty floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      hurried outside to deal with the crowd while Ian took Bryce’s pulse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      raised his head slowly, watching Ian as he pinched his wrist. He’d stopped bleeding.
      The small bullet hole in his stomach had started to scab over. His skin was
      a sickly gray color. I’d never seen anyone so pale. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce dropped
      his head back onto the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hungry,” he groaned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      was still holding on to Bryce’s wrist. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No pulse.” Ian shook
      his head, confused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris hurried back into the granary and fell
      to his knees beside Bryce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I can’t find a pulse,” Ian said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No
      shit you can’t find a pulse! He doesn’t have any fucking blood left! What do
      you think?” Chris shined a light into Bryce’s eyes. “Can you stand up?” he asked
      him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce shook his head. “No legs.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The bullet
      must have hit his spine,” Chris said. “He can’t move his legs at all.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Hungry</i>,”
      Bryce whimpered again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How is he <i>conscious</i>?” Ian dropped
      Bryce’s wrist and sat back on his heels. “I don’t fucking understand!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      grabbed a disposable syringe from a box on his desk. He kneeled beside Bryce
      while unwrapping the packaging, then he tossed aside the clear plastic. He jabbed
      Bryce’s forearm. He pulled the plunger backward, drawing fluid into the syringe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      came out of Bryce’s vein wasn’t blood. It was a deep amber color, translucent,
      and thick like bacon grease left over in a skillet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Honey,” Chris
      said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What the <i>fuck</i>?” Ian looked closer at the syringe.
      “I don’t get it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t really get it either,” Chris admitted.
      “Somehow the pathogen has replaced his blood with its own honey. His heart’s
      stopped beating, but the honey is <i>oozing</i> through his veins somehow. It’s
      keeping him conscious.” Chris shook his head in amazement. “The larvae must
      need tons of protein and sugars to produce so much honey. That must be why he’s
      so hungry. The pathogen needs him to eat. It needs the food energy.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      flopped his head from one side to the other. His face was ashen. His hair was
      slicked with sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just—want to fuck,” he stammered. He started
      to cry. “Want to <i>fuck</i> so <i>bad</i>,” he whimpered. “Can’t. <i>Can’t</i>.”
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce weakly pounded his hip with his fist. His legs lay limp,
      bent in the same awkward angle they’d landed in when Ian had lowered him from
      the wheelbarrow. It was obvious Bryce couldn’t feel or move anything from the
      waist down. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Want to fuck so <i>bad</i>,” he stammered, sobbing
      now. A thick, greasy tear spilled from his eye. “Why? <i>Why</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      couldn’t watch any longer. I knew the pathogen was going into overdrive making
      Bryce crave sex, and now there wasn’t anything he could do about it. Everything
      below his upper torso was useless and numb. It was driving him mad. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      had to focus on something else. If I stayed here doing nothing but stare at
      Bryce in his misery I’d start to go mad too. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stepped away and
      tried not to listen to Bryce’s whimpering. Instead, I started rummaging through
      the bin of military rations Chris had been living on. I’d wanted to bring Morgan
      something to eat from the house, but when we all had to rush away, I didn’t
      even have enough time to grab a jacket, let alone extra food. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      found a pouch of vacuum-packed oatmeal and a sleeve of strawberry jelly at the
      bottom of the bin. It would have to do. I felt awful feeding Morgan like this.
      It was like she was some captured beast and I was bringing her a treat. But
      I refused to think of her as anything but human. I grabbed one of the kerosene
      burners and made my way as quietly as I could toward Morgan’s silo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      I unlocked the door, she was asleep. She was curled up in a little ball against
      the tin wall. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>She actually looked peaceful. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      appeared as though she’d been surviving mostly on candy bars. There were wrappers
      scattered all around her unlit lantern. But she was breathing evenly. She was
      deeply at rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remembered that Ian had said that she hadn’t
      been sleeping well. Now that she was, I didn’t want to wake her. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      I didn’t want to leave, either. I felt comforted with Morgan nearby. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So,
      for a long time I just sat in the silo’s quiet semi-darkness, listening to Morgan
      breathe, trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      knew I had to go back to the house. I still had to get Jason’s pharmacy access
      card. Now that I was a wanted fugitive again, I had no idea how I was going
      to get it, but I had to. Somehow, I <i>had to</i> make him think I wanted to
      sleep with him. It was the only way. I refused to let Morgan progress to stage
      three. She’d be totally lost to me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it wasn’t just for Morgan
      now. It was for all the refugees who needed help. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it was
      for myself, too. If it turned out Bryce had infected me, there was no way I
      was letting myself progress past stage one. There was no way I was letting what
      was happening to Morgan happen to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A gunshot rang out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      leapt up, expecting to see Home Guard troops raiding the granary. But when I
      peered from the silo door, the granary yard was empty. And silent. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      gunshot had come from inside the granary itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I raced across
      the yard, trying not to trip in the weeds. I flung the wire-hinged door open
      and hurried into the dim interior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My eyes adjusted to the light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      was still lying on the granary floor. Chris and Ian were standing over him.
      Ian was holding his head in his heads. Chris stood with his arms folded, staring
      down at Bryce, holding a pair of tweezers. Nobody was speaking. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce
      was motionless. He was holding a small pistol in his hand. He clutched it loosely
      at his throat. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stepped closer. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I could see
      that the back of Bryce’s head was missing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chunk of his skull
      had been blown off by the pistol. A mass of tiny larvae was streaming from the
      wound. Almost immediately each one of them writhed and died, as if contact with
      the open air killed them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris picked up one larva with the tweezers
      and dropped it into a vial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What did you <i>do</i>!” I screamed.
      “You didn’t have to <i>kill</i> him!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley.” Ian rubbed his
      forehead. He looked exhausted. “We have to keep quiet.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      slipped the pistol out of Bryce’s hand and tucked it into a holster concealed
      under his shirt. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We didn’t kill him,” Chris said. “He asked
      me for a gun. I gave one to him.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian looked at Chris warily,
      but he looked too defeated to make any objection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What <i>should
      </i>I have done?” Chris asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Not</i> give him your fucking
      gun!” I struggled to keep my voice as low as possible. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And then
      what?” Chris answered, angrily. “You think I could have treated him? Even if
      I had any more antibiotics, which I don’t—I gave the last dose to Morgan two
      days ago—I couldn’t do a fucking thing about his severed spinal cord. Could
      I? He was <i>miserable</i>. He asked for a gun, and I gave him one. Am I really
      going to tell him no? And just watch him progress to stage three, in that state?
      Just let him live in a nightmare for four or five months until he expires? Fuck
      you, I’m not doing that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Where’s Lindsay?” I looked around the
      granary. “Where’s his son?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“They’re in the silo with the others,”
      Ian said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stepped behind me and put his hands on my shoulders,
      trying to calm me down. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley,” he whispered, “Lindsay agreed
      with Chris about giving him the gun. We put her and the kid in the silo before
      he did it. Mrs. Thomas is taking care of her. Lindsay seems pretty tough. She’s
      handling it. The kid’s too young to know what happened.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I turned
      from Bryce’s corpse and pulled away from Ian. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just sit down
      for a minute,” Ian said, pulling back the chair at Chris’s desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      sat. But I was afraid that Ian wasn’t acting with enough urgency. It was only
      a matter of time before the Home Guard discovered the granary, especially if
      other people already knew about it. They’d even had a name for the meager resistance
      movement. They’d called it the as if everyone already knew exactly what that
      meant. Somehow word was getting out that we were sheltering positives here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We
      can’t stay here,” I said. “They’ll find us here. They’re going to search the
      whole ranch.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No, we can’t stay here. You’re right.” Ian looked
      totally at a loss. “But where <i>else</i>? I didn’t count on having this many
      people. I was going to drive around looking for an empty house. Maybe someplace
      the Home Guard has registered as unoccupied. But finding something like that
      could take days.” He glanced at me, chagrinned. “I <i>know</i> we don’t have
      days, Ash. I’m trying to figure something out. I just need a little time to
      fucking think about the right place to hide. because just yet, I’m sorry, but
      I’m not coming up with anything.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An idea that had been floating
      around my consciousness since last evening suddenly surfaced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      knew of a place where we could hide—maybe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The place I had in
      mind would take the Home Guard months to find, if they ever found it at all.
      And it was a place where we could take all of the refugees who were in the silo.
      Maybe even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem was, I didn’t know <i>where</i> it
      was. Not exactly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would have to ask my dad. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      most importantly, wherever we went, we would need a supply of antibiotics. Even
      the most secure refugee hideout in the world would be mostly useless if we didn’t
      have a way to keep positives from progressing to the disease’s later stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      stood up and faced Ian squarely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I need to borrow your gun.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Wait,
      what?” He was confused. “Why?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m going back to the house,”
      I said firmly. “I’m going to get the pharmacy access card from Jason.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      can’t be serious.” Ian looked more frustrated now than I’d ever seen him. He
      was so upset it looked like he thought I’d betrayed him. “You’re out of your
      fucking mind! That plan’s over now, Ashley! Forget it! They’ll have <i>warrants</i>
      for our arrest. Shawn wasn’t bluffing about that. They’ll arrest you on the
      spot. They might even <i>shoot </i>you on the spot. There’s <i>no way</i> you
      or I can go back to the house now. You’re just being reckless! We have to be
      realistic.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ian, listen to me.” I did my best to keep my cool
      and speak as reasonably and forcefully as possible. “You want me to be realistic?
      Here’s realistic. There’s <i>no</i> other way. If we need more antibiotics,
      we need that access card. And I’m the only one who has a <i>chance</i> of getting
      it from Jason.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian looked at me pleadingly. “I’m not letting
      you do this. Ashley, honestly, listen to me.” He whispered, “I don’t know what
      I would do if I lost you. Do you understand? <i>I</i> can’t lose you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      put his arms around my shoulders and drew me close, pressing my head against
      his chest. I felt like I might cry, but I forced myself not to. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      slipped my hands around his waist. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then I grabbed his gun from
      his belt and pulled away from him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’re not going to lose me,”
      I said. “Ian, that’s <i>why</i> I have to do this.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ran out
      the door before he could stop me, then I sprinted up the riverbank, clutching
      Ian’s gun, careful to keep under the cover of the trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">T</span>he Home Guard was already at the
      house when I got there. From the riverbank, I could see Jason’s military vehicle
      parked in the driveway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sneaked toward the back of the house.
      On the way up the river, I’d hastily constructed a plan for getting Jason alone.
      I couldn’t go inside without anyone else seeing me. My only chance was to wait
      outside the bathroom window and hope I could catch him using it. It was risky,
      I knew. But there wasn’t any other way. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>An old, overgrown lilac
      bush stood just outside the house’s downstairs bathroom window. Luckily, it
      still had most of its leaves. I crawled between it and the house, crouching
      just below the window sill. I was pretty sure no one would see me hiding there.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My mom had cooked lunch again for the Home Guard. I could tell
      because I could smell her beef stew. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rangers’ voices droned
      on while they ate in the kitchen. Occasionally, I heard my mom’s voice pipe
      up, and I could hear Jason’s voice too, along with Shawn’s, but I couldn’t make
      out anything that anyone was saying. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, my plan was on track
      because Jason’s squad had actually stopped for lunch, just like I’d hoped they
      would. They had to know we were missing by now, but luckily they weren’t rushing
      off to find us, like I’d worried they might do. The squad was taking its time
      eating. But for everything to work like I’d planned, a lot more still had to
      go my way. First of all, Jason had to use the bathroom before he left. And I
      had no idea how likely it was that he actually would.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don’t
      know how long I waited until someone finally came to use the bathroom. Whoever
      it was opened the window right away. The sash slid up right above my head. I
      held my breath. I didn’t move. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard someone peeing. A guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      couldn’t show myself unless I knew for sure it was Jason. But that was the problem.
      To look through the window I would have to expose myself for a moment, showing
      my face before ducking back down. If it was Shawn who was peeing right now,
      or anyone but Jason, and he saw me through the window, I’d be arrested. Maybe
      shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took a deep, quiet breath. I didn’t have much time. I
      would have to look quickly, before whoever it was finished peeing and still
      had his back to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started counting down from three, poised
      to raise my head and duck as quickly as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Three . .
      . Two . . .</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, whoever was in the bathroom coughed
      and spit through the window. A mass of saliva and phlegm shot into the lilac
      bush, attached itself to a branch, and dripped down the bark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just
      from the sound of the cough alone, I knew it was Shawn, not Jason. I’d lived
      with him for a long time. I was sure it was him. If I’d raised my head a moment
      earlier, he would have seen me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I held my breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      heard him grumbling and gasping as he struggled to wash his hands while one
      of them was shot through and bandaged. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then he left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another
      fifteen minutes passed, and I heard the rangers saying goodbye to my mom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Shit.</i>
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason hadn’t gone to the bathroom. Fuck him and his fucking big-ass
      bladder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just when I started to crawl from beneath the window,
      someone hurried into the bathroom. Instantly I heard a heavy stream of piss
      churning into the toilet bowl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t waste any time. I peeked
      quickly through the window and ducked back down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Jason.
      I could only see the back of his head, but I was sure it was him. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      stood quietly, raised the gun, and pointed it through the window directly at
      Jason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as he was done peeing, just as he was zipping up,
      I whispered, “Those pills you gave me were fucking incredible.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His
      head snapped around. His eyes met mine, startled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I said, “You
      draw your gun you know I’ll shoot you.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now he smiled coolly.
      “Well, well, well. There you are. Ashley, if you shoot me, my whole squad’ll
      be on you in seconds flat. But I won’t draw. Not just yet. I like you.” He turned
      and approached the window, stepping confidently toward my gun’s barrel. He planted
      his hands on the sill. “You liked those pills? Fucking good, aren’t they. And
      now you want more.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You got any?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Not on me right
      now.” He laughed softly. “Jesus. What makes you think I’d give any more to you,
      anyway? You’re a wanted fugitive. I have the go-ahead to shoot you on sight.
      Did you know that? Your husband’s ready to skin your hide. He wouldn’t fuck
      you with a rubber on a ten-foot pole.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And what about you?” I
      asked. “How do you feel about this whole situation? You haven’t shot me yet.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No,”
      he said, smiling. “No I haven’t. Have I?” He spoke softly, bringing his face
      closer to mine. “I don’t like to be rash. After all, there’s such a thing as
      protection. Besides, you came to say hello to me. Didn’t you? That was a very
      friendly thing to do. You must like me after all.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,” I said,
      forcing myself to smile coyly while keeping my gun raised. “You’re the sergeant,”
      I leaned forward and whispered into his ear. “Out of all these privates, I hear
      you have the biggest gun. And you like to party. What’s not to like?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      <i>knew </i>you liked to party!” Jason slapped his hand on the sill like he’d
      just won the lottery, “I <i>knew</i> it. I saw you that night at the fair, and
      I <i>knew</i> you liked to get fucked up. Why you been holding out on me, Ashley?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      pouted. “Well, my marriage isn’t exactly working out, is it?” I tried not to
      ham it up too much. I was pretty sure I had him, and I didn’t want to ruin it
      now. “It’s just getting kind of <i>boring</i> out here on the run,” I said carefully.
      “And I’m getting <i>lonely</i>. How soon can you get some more of those pills?
      I thought maybe we could hook up later on tonight. They give you time off, don’t
      they?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley. I’m the sergeant.” Jason’s tone was brimming with
      smug confidence. “I can take time off whenever the fuck I want.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And
      you can get more of those pills whenever the fuck you want too?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      can get them. You fucking bet I can get them. I’ll get you some that are even
      better than those last ones.” He smiled. “As long as you share.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      smiled back at him. “If you can get them,” I whispered, “oh, I’ll share all
      right. I’ll be at your house at eleven tonight then? You’ll be there? You better
      be there.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Whoa, whoa, Ash,” Jason said. “No. <i>Not</i> there.
      If you want me to keep all this on the down low and not arrest or shoot your
      tight little ass, you can’t be anywhere near my house. If anyone found out about
      this, I’d be fucked. Got that? If I’m doing you a favor by not turning you in
      <i>and</i> hooking you up, then we gotta do this how I say.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Where
      then?” I braced myself. I thought I’d had him, but now I wasn’t so sure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      was I getting myself into?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That bend in the highway,” he said,
      gesturing out beyond the barn. “Just past this place. Do you know where I mean?
      Where that little gully is? You just hang tight there tonight, and I’ll pick
      you up. Got it?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew the place he meant. I also knew that getting
      into any kind of vehicle with Jason was a bad idea. I’d imagined dropping in
      on his shitty little house and finding him already halfway wasted by the time
      I got there. I’d even planned on asking Ian to hide outside in the dark in case
      anything went wrong. Driving around alone with Jason was completely different.
      He could take me anywhere he wanted, and nobody would be there to back me up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      what else could I do? It was this or nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I grabbed his collar
      and whispered, “I’ll be there at eleven. Don’t be late.”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">A</span>s soon as Jason’s military vehicle
      drove away, and I was sure all the rangers in his squad were gone, I slipped
      out to the feed shed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t risk going inside the house.
      I had no idea what my mom or Danielle would do if they saw me. After this morning,
      I wouldn’t have been surprised if they turned me in. And I didn’t even know
      if Shawn was still there or not, nursing his wound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I knew
      my dad always fed his cattle before sundown. He did the same thing without fail
      every day of his life. If I waited for him at the feed shed long enough, I was
      sure he’d show up eventually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also knew that I’d bought us all
      some time at the granary. As long as Jason was planning on partying with me,
      he wasn’t going to look very hard for anybody on my parents’ property. No matter
      how hard Shawn pushed him to find us, Jason was the boss. And I knew he’d much
      rather sleep with Shawn’s wife than have to shoot me, given the options. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      laid down in the hay scattered all over the feed shed. The cattle were already
      milling around, waiting for my dad to feed them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was quiet
      here, and peaceful. It reminded me of when I was a kid and I used to help my
      dad feed his cattle. The scent of the fresh hay was sweet and rich, and it filled
      my lungs as I breathed in the air. It almost felt like nothing had changed.
      No pathogen, no quarantine. Just my dad’s feed shed filled with hay, just like
      it had always been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I must have fallen to sleep, because when
      I woke up the sun was setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad was tossing loose hay into
      the troughs, and the cattle were chewing lazily. He hadn’t even seen me asleep
      in the dark corner of the shed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Dad,” I whispered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      turned around, startled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s me,” I said. “It’s okay.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      stepped from the shadows. When my dad set eyes on me, he looked incredibly relieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      gave me a long, tight hug. He even lifted me from the ground a little, like
      he used to do when I was little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My Ashley,” he said. “I’m so
      glad you’re okay. You have no idea how worried I’ve been about you.” He hugged
      me again. “The world’s all gone to hell, hasn’t it?” he said softly. “What the
      hell are we all going to do?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, I’m not going to stand around
      doing nothing,” I said. “That’s for sure.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad looked at me
      warily. I could tell he was worried that I’d get hurt, or worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      need your help,” I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My help? How?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I just
      need you to tell me something.” I was sure no one else was around, but I lowered
      my voice. “You remember when I was a kid and we took that cross-country horseback
      trip? Way out in the mountains? And we found those ruins? That village carved
      in the rock? And you told me not to ever tell anyone about it?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      dad looked around the feed shed. He craned his head to look out the window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      don’t remember anything like that,” he said. “What are you talking about? That’s
      ridiculous, this far north. The Anasazi never set foot past southern Colorado.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Dad.”
      I couldn’t help but laugh a little. He was this serious about keeping a secret.
      “No one can hear us. We’re alone. We can talk about it. It’s okay. But I need
      you to tell me where those cliff dwellings are. It’s important. People’s lives
      are at stake. I can’t tell you why, but they are. You told me once that the
      Anasazi built those dwellings way out there to hide from a brutal enemy. Now
      I need to hide, just like they did. Do you understand? And I have no idea how
      to get there.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad sighed. He glanced out the feed-shed window
      one last time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Does Ian know about this?” he asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No,”
      I whispered. “Not yet. But he needs a place to hide as bad as I do.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      dad nodded. “And if you went out there, he’d go with you?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I nodded.
      “Yes.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Good,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He turned to leave the feed
      shed. It was almost dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Stay here,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      fifteen minutes he came back with a Ziploc bag. Inside was a black garbage bag
      folded neatly into sections. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He removed it from the Ziploc bag
      and unwrapped it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside was a topographical map.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      dad unfolded the map’s sections, then pointed to a tiny, penciled-in <i>X.</i>
      He tapped it with his finger. Then he wrapped the map back up in the bags and
      handed it to me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, there was a scream at the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      dad looked at me for a moment, confused, then we both ran toward the lighted
      back porch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did my best to stuff the map into the back of my
      pants as we ran. I didn’t have anywhere else to put it. When we neared the porch,
      there was another scream. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Get her off!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was
      Tyler’s voice, I realized now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the dim screen window that
      lead to the washroom, I could see a commotion, but I couldn’t make out anything
      but shadows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Get her <i>off</i>!” Tyler shouted again in a terrified
      panic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was only now, hearing Tyler’s terrified scream, that
      I remembered the moment I’d left Morgan asleep in the silo. I’d heard Bryce’s
      gunshot, and I had rushed straight to the granary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I’d left
      without locking the door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no choice but to rush to the house.
      I had to risk being seen by my mom or Danielle. I had to risk even Shawn seeing
      me, if he was there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I reached the washroom, I saw exactly
      what I’d feared. But it was even worse than I’d imagined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler’s
      pants were around his ankles. Morgan was completely naked. Her legs were locked
      around Tyler’s waist. Her arms were locked around his neck. He’d fallen onto
      his back against a pile of muddy boots, and Morgan’s pelvis was grinding away
      furiously as she perched on top of him. She was starting to moan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They’d
      obviously been having sex. They still were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m so sorry,” Tyler
      cried, pushing at Morgan without budging her. Tears were streaming down his
      cheeks. “I’m so <i>sorry</i>! I couldn’t help it! I couldn’t <i>help</i> it!
      Now she won’t <i>stop</i>!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I understood exactly what must have
      happened. Without another dose of antibiotics, Morgan’s infection had progressed.
      Maybe even as far as stage three. Without being locked inside the silo, she’d
      wondered to the house in a sex-crazed stupor. Tyler must have been the first
      person she’d seen. She’d stripped her clothes. She must have been saturated
      with pheromones. Even now I could feel a strange, lustful dizziness. Tyler hadn’t
      had a chance. He was just a fourteen-year old kid who was full of his own adolescent
      hormones anyway. He’d probably been tempted into letting Morgan seduce him,
      then he’d screamed out when he’d realized that he couldn’t get her off of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      rushed to the floor and tried to pull Morgan away. But I couldn’t believe her
      strength. Her legs and arms were locked so tightly around Tyler that I couldn’t
      even budge them. The rigidity of her muscles must have been some strange effect
      of the pathogen. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Get her <i>off!</i>” Tyler screamed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m
      trying, sweetie,” I said. “I’m trying!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan’s moaning grew
      louder. I pulled at her arms with all my might, and still I couldn’t budge her.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Morgan!” I yelled. “You have to stop. Snap out of it! Morgan!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      she just clung more tightly to Tyler’s body. She grinded her pelvis even harder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’m
      so sorry, Aunt Ashley,” Tyler wailed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried again to pull Morgan
      off, but this only made her cling even tighter. She bit Tyler’s ear. Tyler screamed,
      but she wouldn’t let go. She just latched her teeth onto his flesh, started
      breathing heavily through her nose, and refused to release her bite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan’s
      moaning intensified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I didn’t do anything to stop her, she
      was going to climax. I remembered what Chris had told me. If she reached that
      point, Tyler would definitely get infected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Get her <i>off</i>!”
      Tyler screamed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stood and searched the washroom for anything
      I could use to pry Morgan off. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing I saw was the
      scarf my mom was making for Haley. I pulled one of the knitting needles from
      the loops of yarn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan was whimpering now. She was grinding
      on top of Tyler with a horrifying speed. She’d locked her fingernails into the
      back of his neck, and she still hadn’t let go of his ear with her teeth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For
      a moment I thought about the night when I’d watched Mr. Hershel raping Morgan.
      I remembered how I hadn’t been able to bring myself to shoot him, and how Ian
      had needed to take the gun from me and do it himself. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Ian
      wasn’t here now. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was up to me to act. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan
      squealed. She arched her back. Any second now, she was going to come. There
      was only one thing I could do to stop her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t let myself
      think about what I was doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I put the tip of the knitting needle
      into her ear. Then I jammed it inside as hard as I could. There was a faint
      crunching sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instantly, Morgan collapsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler
      slid away, backing himself into the corner of the washroom. He was sobbing.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, there was a loud knocking on the front door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Home
      Guard!” someone shouted “Open now!” I heard my mom shriek with relief and rush
      to let them in. She must have called the Home Guard herself when she’d seen
      Morgan prowling around the house. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I couldn’t move. All I
      could do was kneel there, frozen, while Tyler cowered in the corner and Morgan’s
      body lay slumped against my knee. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d just killed my best friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried to understand this fact, but I just felt numb. I knew I needed to stand
      up and run, but I couldn’t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Home Guard’s booted footsteps
      pounded through the kitchen toward me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But all I could do was
      look mutely at my right hand. It was like it belonged to somebody else. My fingers
      were still tightly clasped around the knitting needle, and covered in Morgan’s
      blood.</p>\r\n</div>"

    - "<div class=\"blog_text\"><p>Okay, I know. So Part 5 is probably the most explicit
      yet. I hope I haven’t offended anyone’s sensibilities. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have
      to admit that I kind of went out of my way to make this last installment pretty
      graphic. Even this censored version goes pretty far. If my dad ever saw what
      I’ve written now, I’d <i>really</i> be in trouble. Seriously. I think he’d probably
      disown me or something and never speak to me again. He’d be so upset. Which,
      I think, is why I wrote it like that. When I was writing the graphic scenes,
      I kept thinking about how disappointed in me he would be, and this just made
      me describe the details even more explicitly. I <i>wanted</i> him to read it.
      I wanted to see his reaction. I’m not so dumb as to actually let him see any
      of this, but sometimes I feel like it’s the only way I could ever get back at
      him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess you’re wondering what I mean by “get back at him.”
      Get back at him for what? Well . . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, I sneaked out
      again with Kyle. And this time he caught me. I’m so stupid. I should have known
      my dad would catch me. Kyle and I didn’t even really do anything but go for
      a quick drive and mess around a little. Nothing like last time. He had to be
      back before his parents got home from some event or something, so I was only
      gone for about a half hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when I climbed back through the
      window, my dad was actually sitting <i>in my room</i>. I almost had a heart
      attack. He even helped pull me back inside so I wouldn’t hurt myself. It was
      so embarrassing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He basically grounded me “indefinitely” from
      everything but homework. He took my phone away. At least he didn’t turn the
      internet off this time. But he actually put a block on my window so it can only
      open like three inches. I don’t know if that’s even legal. He said he didn’t
      want me to hurt myself. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I don’t know when I’ll be able to
      see Kyle again. Maybe never. I haven’t even told him what happened yet. I’m
      trying to figure out how to say it in an email. He’s probably tried to text
      me, and he’s probably wondering why I haven’t texted him back. I think I might
      be putting off writing to him because when I do I’ll have to face up to the

    - "<div class=\"novel_text\"><p><span class=\"first_letter\">F</span>rom my hiding
      place beside the highway I heard someone approaching along the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      footsteps were slow and even, coming from way off in the distance. I sat up
      and stretched my back, making sure to keep low enough so that I would still
      be concealed behind the gully’s rocks and brush. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was dawn.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was still cold, but not as miserably cold as I’d been all night.
      The sun was about to rise over the plains. I could see now that the leaves of
      the cottonwoods I’d been sleeping under were beginning to turn from green to
      an autumn yellow. But as I peered through the branches and searched the highway,
      I still couldn’t see who was coming. The person was still on the far side of
      the bend in the road and concealed by the hillside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they were
      definitely getting closer. Now I could hear what sounded like something being
      dragged. With every other footstep came the sound of a chain clinking across
      the road’s dry asphalt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally a tiny figure emerged from around
      the bend. I looked around at my hiding spot in the gully, making sure that I
      was still concealed from the highway now that it was daylight. I was sitting
      within a few steps from the road, but I was pretty sure whoever was coming wouldn’t
      be able to see me behind the cover of sage and low cottonwood branches. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was a girl. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This came as a surprise, because the dragging chain
      sounded heavy. She was walking with a slow, even pace. She didn’t appear to
      be struggling at all. She just took one step accompanied by the dragging sound,
      then another quiet step, followed again by another step with the dragging sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As
      she drew closer, I could tell that she was only about eleven or twelve years
      old. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t recognize her. She must have been someone from
      out of town. She had long brown hair, pulled back behind her ears, and she was
      wearing a dress. The dress looked like something she could have worn to a wedding,
      or maybe to church, except that it was filthy. What had once been white fabric
      was now a soiled, dull gray, closely matching the color of her equally filthy
      skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This uniform filth was probably why I didn’t notice immediately
      that her dress was torn. The entire front section had been ripped away, revealing
      everything bellow her belly button. And she wasn’t wearing any underwear. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      heart started to race. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the girl came closer, I could see that
      her eyes were a beautiful green, but they were deeply sunken. And she was incredibly
      thin. Her hipbones jutted sharply from her waist. And yet her expression was
      perfectly calm. She was just staring straight ahead, keeping an even pace as
      she made her way down the empty road. She behaved as if she was perfectly clean
      and healthy, as if her dress was perfectly in tact, and as if everything below
      her waist wasn’t exposed for all the world to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, also,
      as if nothing was attached to her foot. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could see now that
      a steel animal trap was clamped around her ankle. Her foot was badly broken
      and twisted unnaturally. The trap’s serrated jaws had dug through her skin,
      revealing her bone. Her toes were blackened and heavily swollen. Six feet of
      chain trailed behind her heel, and yet she was barely limping at all. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hey!”
      I shouted. I stepped out from the behind the brush. “Are you okay? You need
      help!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The girl didn’t respond. I clambered down the gully and
      onto the road. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Stop!” I was close enough to her now to hear
      her steady breathing. “You need help. Sweetie, where are your parents? Stop!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She
      didn’t slow her pace. I actually had to step out of the way so she wouldn’t
      bump into me. She just kept her gaze pointed at the far end of the road where
      it turned around the next bend. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could smell her. Her foot was
      gangrenous. She smelled rotten. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>She kept walking, and I didn’t
      follow after her. She just kept marching casually onward, mostly naked, dragging
      the trap with her broken foot. The sound of the chain’s jangling grew fainter
      as she moved on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What more could I do? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was in
      no position to help her. I had no idea how I was going to keep even <i>myself</i>
      alive today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The girl was obviously TGV-positive, and far advanced
      into stage three. She didn’t even register my presence. She must have been dumped
      into the quarantine zone from the outside, then left to fend for herself. It
      was possible that she’d stumbled onto the animal trap in the woods, but I suspected
      that someone had set traps around their property, afraid of wandering positives.
      She must have been caught in it, then pulled the chain free from wherever the
      trap had been staked into the ground. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now where was she going,
      this little girl? With such a blind purpose? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I watched as she
      disappeared around the bend. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t be sure, but my only
      guess was that she was moving toward what the Home Guard had called a “cluster.”
      The pathogen must have given her an ability to sense where other positives were
      gathering, just like I’d seen other positives gathering in a cluster days ago,
      before Jason had swathed them down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My God. She was so young.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d
      been standing exposed in the middle of the road for too long. I made my way
      back up the gully to my hiding place in the cottonwoods. I couldn’t let anyone
      see me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sat on the ground. It was morning now, and I had no
      food, no plan, and, honestly, no hope at all. I had no idea what I was going
      to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as I tried to pull myself together, I was suddenly
      certain of one thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I no longer regretted what I’d done to Morgan.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Morgan had known that her fate was to become like that desperately
      blank little girl of a human body I'd just seen walking along the highway, she
      would have <i>wanted</i> someone to end her existence. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or at
      least I hoped she would have wanted it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If she would have chosen
      <i>that</i> over death, I’d wish I were dead myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as I
      thought about how Morgan had been locked away in that silo during the last days
      of her existence, surrounded by her books and her collected trash, I suddenly
      knew exactly what I had to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>’d
      been trying not to think about what had happened all night. Now, I let myself
      remember the moment I shoved the knitting needle into her ear: the moment I
      ended her life—or <i>expired</i> her, or whatever they called it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      remembered how I knew I needed to stand up and run, fast, but that I couldn’t
      bring myself to do anything but stare at the bloodied knitting needle in my
      hand. I remembered the boot steps of the Home Guard pounding through the house
      toward me. I remembered the ranger racing into the wash room, leaping past me,
      then kneeling beside Tyler, clutching my nephew in one arm while discreetly
      helping him pull his jeans back up with the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remembered
      realizing, slowly, that it hadn’t been the Home Guards’ boot steps that had
      been pounding through the house. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>They had been Ian’s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian
      had discovered that Morgan was missing and had run straight from the granary
      to the house. When he’d heard Tyler crying out, he’d shouted “Home Guard!” to
      try to scare Morgan, probably not realizing how far progressed she’d gotten
      and that she had no capacity left to fear anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still hadn’t
      been able to bring myself to move at that point. Morgan’s slumped, naked body
      lay awkwardly at my knees. Her elbow rested limply on my thigh. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      watched Ian taking in the scene of Morgan lying dead, Tyler still sobbing, mortified,
      and me dumbly holding a blood-soaked knitting needle. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I stopped
      her in time,” I mumbled. “She didn’t c...” I began. “She didn’t<i> finish</i>.
      Tyler should be okay, I think.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Ian could say anything,
      Danielle arrived in the laundry room, practically tripping over me as she came
      in. She saw Morgan, then she saw Tyler buttoning up his jeans. For a moment
      she looked like she might pass out, then she just bent over and put her hands
      between her knees. She started sobbing without making a sound. It seemed as
      though maybe this was all more than she could take and she was about to completely
      break down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What have you done!” she suddenly shrieked at me.
      “Why didn’t you let them take her away? Now . . . <i>this!</i> She did <i>this</i>
      to my son! Your own <i>nephew</i>!” She gestured toward Tyler indignantly and
      held me in a hateful glare. “What have you done?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian grabbed
      Danielle as she started to pitch forward, crying so intensely now that her words
      became unintelligible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Listen, Danielle.” Ian spoke firmly, wrapping
      his arms around her. “It wasn’t Ashley. It was me. Do you understand? <i>I’ve</i>
      been sheltering Morgan. This is all my fault. Not Ashley’s. I think Ashley may
      have in fact just saved Tyler. She stopped Morgan just in time, before it was
      too late. Tyler’s probably <i>safe</i>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My sister jerked away
      from Ian’s arms. “<i>Safe</i>? How can you <i>possibly</i> know that for sure?”
      Then she slumped forward again, sobbing. “I’m just so scared,” she said. “<i>So</i>
      scared. Things are only getting worse.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that Tyler had his
      pants on, he hurried off to his room, shaken and embarrassed. He refused to
      look anywhere near Morgan’s body as he rushed away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian walked
      my sister into the kitchen. I still hadn’t moved from the floor. From the dark
      washroom, I watched my brother-in-law embracing Danielle, stroking her hair,
      whispering into her ear as he comforted her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment I would
      have given anything to trade places with my sister. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew I
      couldn’t stay at the house long. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily it turned out that Shawn
      wasn’t there. He was still required to bunk at the Center, even with his wounded
      hand. Still, it wasn’t safe for me to be at the house. Ian had taken Danielle
      to talk with Tyler in my sister’s old bedroom, and I decided I should give them
      a few minutes together, as a family. Then I would ask Ian what to do with Morgan’s
      body and leave as quickly as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to think calmly and
      practically, or I knew I’d go crazy. For now, I tried not to let myself think
      about Morgan as a person or as my best friend at all. If I let myself feel anything,
      it was the vague desire to have Ian to myself for a few minutes, and for him
      to put his arms around me, for just a moment, and to let him give me a little
      comfort after what I’d just done. I’d lost my best friend. If anyone would understand
      what that meant, it would be Ian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After fifteen minutes or so
      I lightly knocked on my sister’s door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after my knock, Ian
      stepped out into the hallway. He closed the door softly behind him and sighed
      with a look of utter defeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I said, “I have to get going. Right
      away.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Look, Ash,” he started, then he sighed again. He had something
      to tell me that he didn’t know how to say. “Danielle knows everything. About
      the granary. The others. Everything. I had to tell her.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t
      believe I was hearing this. “But why? <i>I</i> left Morgan’s door unlocked.
      It was <i>my</i> fault, not yours. <i>You </i>didn’t place your family in danger.
      You <i>know</i> Danielle will report the granary to the Home Guard,” I whispered.
      “You <i>know</i> she will!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“She will.” Ian nodded. “You’re right.
      She will. And I should have let her do it a long time ago.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      realized that I could actually hear my sister through the door, faintly, speaking
      on the phone right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was so confused and taken by surprise
      at what Ian had done, I didn’t know what to say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Look, Ash,”
      he whispered. “I’ve put my family in danger. I don’t know what I was thinking.
      Hiding refugees on your parents’ property? While my kids are staying at the
      house? If we tried to keep this up, more and more refugees would arrive. There’s
      nowhere to put them, not realistically, not right now anyway. Who knows what
      would happen next? I hope to God Tyler’s okay, but what about the next time
      someone wandered up here? What then? What about Haley?” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian gave
      me a stern, hardened look. I hadn’t realized until now how angry he was at me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And
      what were <i>you</i> thinking, sleeping with Bryce like that last night? What
      were you <i>thinking</i>? Am I going to have to protect my family from you next?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      didn’t think it was possible to feel any lower, but my heart sank. I didn’t
      know what I would do if Ian wasn’t on my side. But he was right. I’d let him
      down. How could he trust me now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to blink back my welling
      tears. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You said this morning you didn’t want to lose me,” I
      whispered. “You said you <i>couldn’t</i> lose me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t <i>want</i>
      to lose you, Ashley. But I think maybe I already have.” He stared straight into
      my eyes. “Look, we’ve always had a connection.” He whispered, “Honestly, there
      are things I can tell you that I couldn’t ever tell my wife. That’s a fact.
      But your sister’s my wife. My kids are <i>my kids</i>. And I’m their father.
      I’m the only one they’ve got to protect them. And they come before anyone else.
      Get it? And, now, here you are sleeping with Bryce fucking Tripp again last
      night?” He stammered, his voice cracking. “That puts <i>all </i>of us in danger.
      Don’t you see? Are you going to end up like Morgan now? Can I let you around
      my kids? How could you <i>do</i> this to me, Ashley?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt tears
      drop down my cheeks. I turned away and covered my face. I couldn’t bear to look
      at Ian. I was so ashamed, and at the same time I couldn’t believe that he wouldn’t
      even acknowledge that I’d just lost Morgan, that <i>I’d</i> had to be the one
      to snuff her out, with my own hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could hear my mom on the
      phone in the living room. Whether or not Danielle had called the Home Guard
      directly to the house, my mom was doing it now. I could hear her reporting that
      there was an infected body to pick up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I have to go,” I whispered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not
      only had I lost Morgan, and Bryce too, but now it looked like I was even losing
      Ian, effectively. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What about you?” I asked him, struggling to
      speak through my tears. “What will you do?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I have to stay here,”
      he said quietly. “At the house. I can’t leave my family vulnerable again. I
      just can’t. I’ll stay in the attic. For now. It’s what I have to do. The Home
      Guard won’t find me up there, even if they come with a search warrant. There’s
      a panel in the wall I can hide behind if anyone comes up there. I can take care
      of myself.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And Morgan?” I asked. “Her body?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The
      Home Guard will take it,” he said. “There’s nothing we can do about that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Danielle
      called out softly to Ian from inside the bedroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ian touched
      my shoulder in a heartbreakingly cold way. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’re on your own
      Ashley,” he whispered. “I’m so sorry. If there was any other way—” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      he cut himself off. For a moment he looked like he was going to hug me, but
      he stopped and said nothing more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to leave. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As
      I stepped away, Ian said, “Ashley, wait,” but I ignored him. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      hurried down the stairs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before going back out into the night,
      there was one thing I had to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad was at the dining table,
      sitting alone. His face was buried in his hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sat beside
      him and put my hand on his back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Dad?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He startled
      a little, as if waking from a dream. He patted my hand, then he looked away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      need to ask you to do something for me,” I whispered. “I told you if I went
      to the ruins, Ian would go with me. But that’s not going to happen. Not anymore.
      He doesn’t know about them yet. And now he <i>can’t</i> know about them. Not
      ever. Don’t say anything about the ruins at all. Not to anyone. Not even to
      Ian. Okay?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad nodded. He was in a daze after everything that
      had happened in his house that day, but I knew he wouldn’t tell a soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      be careful,” He whispered. He turned and hugged me. “Love you, kid.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was all I could do not to break down crying in his arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I love
      you too, Dad.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled away from my father’s embrace and hurried
      out the back door into a dark, moonless night.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">I</span>
      ran as fast as I could toward the granary. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before anything else,
      I had to warn Chris that the Home Guard was on its way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could
      barely see where I was going, but I found the riverbank in the darkness. I didn’t
      stop running until I reached the empty grain yard and felt for the granary’s
      rickety door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found the loose knob, and I pushed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside,
      it was completely dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Chris?” I called out softly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There
      was no answer. The granary was totally silent. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt my way
      toward Chris’s desk. My hand bumped into his soda-can ashtray. I faintly smelled
      the scent of stale, burnt weed. Next to the ashtray, I felt a cigarette lighter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      flicked its igniter. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A weak flame leapt up and went out. The
      lighter was almost out of fluid. I shook it, and tried to light it again. A
      tiny flame appeared, and wavered. But this time it stayed lit. I cupped my hand
      around this meager light source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything in the granary was
      gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except for the ash tray and a few empty antibiotics boxes
      strewn across the dusty desk, all of Chris’s supplies had disappeared. Even
      his worn-out swivel chair was gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lighter went out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      lit it again as I stepped around the elevator engines toward the back of the
      granary, doing my best to protect the flame as I moved. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two bodies,
      both covered in the same grease-stained sheet, lay atop Chris’s makeshift examination
      table. I knew the first was Mr. Hershel’s, and the other must have been Bryce’s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again,
      I called out for Chris. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hurried
      outside and checked each of the silos. All of them were empty. The refugees
      were gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no idea how Chris got word that the resistance
      was in danger of being discovered, but someone had obviously tipped him off.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone had fled, but to where I had no idea. I didn’t even
      have Chris’s cell phone number, so there was no way of finding out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was totally on my own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I couldn’t stay here. After my sister’s
      call, the Home Guard would raid the place as fast as they could get a squad
      ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After what had happened with Morgan, I’d almost completely
      forgotten about the date I’d set up with Jason Gibbs that night. My one and
      only option seemed to be to wait at the bend in the highway where we’d agreed
      to meet, and hope he’d show up. What else was I going to do? Morgan was gone,
      but there were other refugee positives who still needed Chris’s antibiotic cocktail.
      If I could manage to steal Jason’s pharmacy access card, maybe somehow I could
      track down Chris and give it to him, now that Ian was out of the picture. I
      just hoped the raid on the granary wouldn’t make it impossible for Jason to
      meet me tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as I was turning to hurry away, I caught
      a glimpse of something on the granary door. Something white standing out against
      the darkness. When I’d rushed through the first time, I’d missed seeing it hanging
      there. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I approached the door, I could just make out that what
      was hanging on it was a piece of notebook paper. It was tacked up with a nail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tore down the paper and lit the lighter. It was a note:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Morgan’s
      trash</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s all it said. Just two words. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What
      the fuck? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a weird phrase. What did <i>that</i> mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At
      first, it seemed like this was some strange, mean-spirited comment about Morgan.
      I almost started to cry again. Why would someone write something like that?
      The Home Guard hadn’t been there yet, so the note had to have been written by
      someone in the Underground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But after I cleared the cobwebs of
      grief from my rational thought processing, I saw that the note couldn’t have
      been just some random disparaging comment about Morgan. I didn’t recognize the
      handwriting, but I could tell it wasn’t Ian’s. I wondered if maybe Chris had
      written the note as some kind of code, warning Ian that Morgan had progressed
      to stage three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even that didn’t make sense. As far as I knew,
      Ian had been with Chris at the granary all day. Why would Chris have needed
      to leave Ian a note? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was the note for <i>me</i>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      turned the paper over. Nothing was on the back. I read the two words on the
      front again. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Morgan’s trash</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no clue
      what the message meant. It had to mean <i>something</i>, but I couldn’t afford
      to hang around at the granary trying to figure it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I folded
      the paper, stuffed it into my pocket, and started making my way through my dad’s
      alfalfa fields toward the bend in the highway and my date with Jason.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">W</span>hen I reached the road, I had no
      idea what time it was. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d been keeping my cell phone off, knowing
      that the Home Guard could track my GPS position, and I didn’t want to risk turning
      it on even just to check the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I climbed up the gully to look
      for a hiding spot behind the cottonwood grove. This was next to impossible in
      the dark, but eventually I managed to feel out a flattish place between some
      boulders. I was well hidden, but if Jason decided to ambush me here with his
      squad, I’d be shit out of luck. The gully above was steep, and there was no
      place to run. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I waited. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not a single car drove
      by. The night grew colder. I was still only wearing a t-shirt with mid-length
      sleeves, and I started to shiver. Soon, I was chilled to the bone. I curled
      up in a tiny ball between the rocks, trying to capture as much of my body heat
      as possible. But I couldn’t stop shivering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A sliver of a moon
      rose between the branches of the cottonwoods, offering practically no extra
      light. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>By now, I had to accept that eleven o’clock must have
      come and gone. It was probably well past midnight, maybe two or three in the
      morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason wasn’t coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe he’d figured
      out I was setting him up. Or maybe the Home Guard was tracking the fugitives
      from the granary, and he couldn’t get away. But one way or another, it was clear
      now that he wasn’t going to meet me tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to sleep.
      But I was miserable. Until now, I’d focused all of my concentration on the prospect
      of stealing Jason’s access card. But now that he hadn’t shown up, my thoughts
      had nowhere to go and nothing to do but fall into a downward spiral of loneliness
      and regret. I don’t think I’d ever felt more hopeless than I did that night,
      shivering in the brush, or more alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When dawn finally arose
      and I saw the girl approaching on the highway, I felt a moment of manic elation
      just at the chance to be in contact with another human being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      when I stepped onto the road and couldn’t break her from her innocently vacant
      stare, it was all I could do not to throw a rock at her back and scream, <i>Talk
      to me! </i> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after the girl was out of sight, I couldn’t
      stop thinking about her empty green eyes and her gruesomely broken foot, trailing
      that chain. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it was only then that I let myself really think
      about Morgan. I mean, that’s when I let myself <i>really </i>think about the
      fact that she’d been sick, just like this girl. It’s when I let myself acknowledge
      that she was really gone, and what I’d done to her. Right after, I’d slipped
      the knitting needle covered in her blood into my back pocket. I took it out
      and looked at it now. I don’t know why I couldn’t get rid of it, but for some
      reason I didn’t want to let go of this reminder of what I’d done. I thought
      about the last calm moment I’d shared with her in the silo. I wished that I
      could have had just a few more minutes with her then, even if it was just to
      sit there beside her while she slept among her filth and discarded wrappers.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that’s when I remembered Chris’s weird note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried to pull myself together. I dried my tears with my sleeve. I took out the
      note, unfolded it, and read it again: <i>Morgan’s trash.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was
      Chris trying to leave a message which he hoped I would understand, but which
      would be meaningless to any Home Guard ranger who found it? None of the rangers
      knew, after all, which silo Morgan had been staying in. Maybe there was something
      there. Maybe Chris had left something else he wanted me to find. It was a long-shot,
      but it was possible. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to get back to the granary.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">J</span>Now that it was daylight, I took
      the long way around my parents’ property. I couldn’t just walk straight through
      the fields again. Instead, I followed the irrigation channels whose tall weeds
      would keep me hidden from view. Once I made it to the river, I kept close to
      the bank. For all I knew, the Home Guard was searching the entire area by now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      I didn’t see anyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The granary was completely empty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      Home Guard, though, had obviously been there. Boot prints were everywhere, and
      all of the weeds in the grain yard had been flattened by heavy vehicles. Mr.
      Hershel’s and Bryce’s bodies were gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Morgan’s silo had
      been mostly untouched. Someone had obviously searched it. The food wrappers
      on the floor, however, were undisturbed. Who would ever pay attention to a bunch
      of trash in the middle of a night raid for fleeing refugees? Even if one of
      the rangers had seen the note on the granary door and had gotten suspicious,
      no one would have known which refugee had been staying where. Trash had been
      left all over the place, in all of the silos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started to search
      through every empty meal-ration packet and discarded candy bar wrapper that
      Morgan had left on the silo floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally I found what I
      was looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside a Hershey’s wrapper, stained with streaks
      of leftover chocolate crumbs, was a much longer note from Chris:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Ashley,</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>If
      you’ve found this, you figured out what the fuck I meant by the note I left
      on the door, and you fucking kick ass. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Sorry to get so
      cryptic, but it was the only way I could think of to get a message to you while
      keeping it from the H.G.’s eyes. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>But you’ll probably never
      find this message anyway, which means I’m writing to nobody, and none of this
      matters…</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>But, fuck it. Just in case you do actually find
      this, listen up. I have a confession to make.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>I haven’t
      always been the most “ethical” of doctors. Before this whole quarantine thing
      happened, I used to sell prescription drugs illegally on the side. And it just
      so happens that Jason Gibbs used to be one of my frequent-flier clients. He
      used to buy all kinds of pills from me. You name the drug, he’d buy it. The
      more powerful the better. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Before Ian tipped me off that
      the H.G. was going to raid the granary, he told me about your plan to steal
      Jason’s pharmacy access card. I just want to say that I think you’re brave as
      shit for wanting to do that. You’re a superstar. I hope you’re still planning
      on doing it, too, because the Underground really, really needs antibiotics.
      Some of the refugees are in bad shape, and progressing fast.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>At
      the bottom of the same candy wrapper you found this note in are two capsule
      pills. One is tied up in the finger of a BLUE latex glove. That one’s a powerful
      sedative. Anyone who takes it will fall unconscious in about twenty minutes.
      The other pill is tied up in the finger of a WHITE latex glove. That one’s just
      a sugar pill. It won’t have any effect at all.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>I figured
      that if you could slip Jason the sedative while you take the sugar pill, in
      twenty minutes he’d be out like a light, and you could take whatever you needed
      from his wallet. Tell him the pills are “grasshoppers.” It’s the street name
      of his favorite drug. Jason fucking loves them. I’ve used the same kind of capsules
      I used whenever I sold him grasshoppers. He won’t know the difference. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Just
      remember, if you do this: give Jason the pill tied in the finger of the BLUE
      latex glove. You take the sugar pill tied in the finger of the WHITE latex glove.
      Don’t mix them up! The pills look identical!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>My cell number
      is 555-436-7260. But don’t call me from your cell! The H.G. will trace your
      position. Call me from a pay phone. Got it?</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Good luck!
      If you can get that access card, you’ll be doing a lot of good for a lot of
      people who really need help.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>I’m out,</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Chris
      </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I shook the Hershey’s wrapper. Two knotted pieces of latex,
      like little un-inflated balloons, fell into my palm. One was blue, the other
      white. I could feel a pill tied inside each of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked
      around the silo. Morgan’s flannel shirt was lying against the wall near the
      place where she used to sleep. I remembered pulling it from her dresser that
      night Ian shot Mr. Hershel and we’d taken Morgan to my parents’ house. It seemed
      like months ago. I put the shirt on and buttoned it up. If I had to sleep outside
      again, it would be useful. It felt good to wear a piece of Morgan’s clothing,
      too. It made me feel close to her. It gave me confidence. And maybe even a little
      hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shirt had a tiny breast pocket. I slipped the pills
      inside and snapped the button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought again about the ghostly
      stage-three girl who’d passed me on the road that morning. I thought about the
      new refugees, who I hoped had escaped the Home Guard last night. I thought about
      everyone else who had contracted the pathogen, and everyone who would contract
      it in the future. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tracking down Jason might be impossible. And
      making him want to sleep with me, now that he’d stood me up, might be impossible.
      Trying to drug him and steal his access card would definitely be the most hopelessly
      dangerous thing I’d ever done. But I had nothing else to live for. And if I
      died trying, maybe at least it would make up for some of the ways I’d let my
      family down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to find Jason.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">A</span>
      couple of miles from my parents’ property was a gas station with a mini-mart.
      It was just on the outskirts of town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoiding roads and walking
      under cover of the trees along the river, I was able to make it there by midday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      approached the gas station cautiously from the riverbank, but as I got closer
      to the road, it was obvious that the place was totally abandoned. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On
      my side of the road, a sign marked the border of Muldoon township. <i>Muldoon,
      POP 647</i>, it read.I’d passed it a million times. That’s probably why I didn’t
      notice at first that something was hanging from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was the body of a Home Guard ranger. Still in uniform. Hanging by a rope from
      one of the sign’s wooden posts. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a bullet hole in his
      head. I didn’t recognize the face. Around his neck hung a cardboard sign that
      read: <i>Sicko Fucker</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Home Guard must have started executing
      its own members who were caught having sex with positives. This was obviously
      a warning from the higher command that if any of the rangers were tempted to
      sleep with anyone suspected of being infected, the punishment would be swift
      and harsh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No wonder Jason didn’t show up last night. He was a
      sergeant, but he still had to answer to a higher chain of command. There was
      obviously a crackdown on wayward rangers, and he’d been afraid of getting caught
      and ending up hanging by the road. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was going to be even harder
      than I’d thought to get him to meet me for sex. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, I wasn’t
      about to give up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I actually found Jason’s home number listed
      in the phone book. The only problem was that I didn’t have my wallet, and I
      didn’t have any change to place a call. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cash register inside
      the mini-mart was locked. I looked around behind the counter for the key, but
      I couldn’t find one. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took another look around the gas station
      to make sure I was alone, then I slid the register off the counter. It slammed
      down onto the floor. I could hear change inside jingling around, but the drawer
      didn’t budge. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I lifted the register, then I heaved it up above
      my head. I did my best to slam it hard against the floor. It crashed down, spun
      over, and rolled against a bank of glass-windowed refrigerators. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some
      of the register’s keys had broken off and scattered across the floor, and the
      receipt ribbon had spooled down the isle, but still the drawer stayed locked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was only then that I noticed a cardboard donation board for Huntington’s disease
      patients on the counter. It was the kind with little quarter-sized slots for
      people to leave their change in. Most of the slots were empty, but people had
      stuffed a total of eight quarters into the cardboard pockets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With
      only passing guilt, I plucked each of the quarters from the donation board.
      I promised myself that if I ever made it out of this alive, I’d donate at least
      a couple of dollars to Huntington’s research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went straight
      into the men’s bathroom. I found exactly what I was looking for: a wall-mounted
      vending machine selling condoms. The boys in my middle school class used to
      come here to buy them, though the closest that most of them ever got to using
      them was to laugh at the names like <i>French Tickler</i>. Luckily, there was
      also a box of garden-variety Trojans. I bought a pack for $1.50, tossed out
      the box, and stuffed the three foil-wrapped condoms into my pocket. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      did my best to freshen up at the sink. I hadn’t showered for more than a day,
      and I’d spent all night outside. I washed my face and armpits with hand soap,
      brushed my teeth with a travel toiletry kit that I’d stolen from the mini-mart
      shelves, and ran water through my hair. But that was as good as it was going
      to get. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It occurred to me that I was truly homeless. I’d slept
      in a gully, stolen spare change from Huntington’s donations, and now here I
      was bathing in a dingy gas station bathroom. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was also starving.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My weird craving for a cheeseburger and a milkshake had morphed,
      strangely, into a craving for anything with lots of calories, preferably sweet.
      This was strange, because normally I’d never had much of a sweet tooth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      grabbed a plastic bag from behind the counter and stuffed it with whatever I
      could find on the shelves: teriyaki jerky, Pop Tarts, Snickers bars. Not exactly
      a square meal, but my options were limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had two quarters
      left. That meant I would be able to make two phone calls. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had
      no choice but to use one quarter to call Jason now and save the last one to
      call Chris later, hopefully after I’d stolen Jason’s access card. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      put one quarter into the pay phone, slipped the last one into my breast pocket
      along with the pills, and dialed the number listed next to Jason’s name in the
      phone book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hoped to God it was the number for his cell, and
      that he’d actually pick up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ringback tone whirred once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason
      picked up right away. I could tell by the sound quality that I’d reached his
      cell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Who’s this?” he demanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Are you on duty?”
      I asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yes, I’m on duty. Who is this?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You stood
      me up.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley?” Right away Jason’s voice hushed. “Shit. Give
      me a second.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a series of shuffling noises, then the
      sound of a car door closing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley, yeah. Look. Sorry about
      that. But it just wasn’t going to work out. They’re kind of cracking down on
      unregulated intimate relations around here. It’s just way too risky.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Unregulated
      intimate relations</i>?” I parroted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, yeah,” he said sheepishly.
      “That’s what they call it. Having sex with a positive is amazing. It’s like
      fucking on ecstasy. And a lot of guys haven’t been careful enough. Now, if you
      get caught fooling around without a license, it’s not pretty. I shouldn’t even
      really be talking to you.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pretended to be hurt. “Have fun jerking
      off for the rest of your life, then,” I said. “I should have known all that
      shit about you being down to party was bullshit. I was even saving my last two
      grasshoppers.” I tried to sound as disappointed as possible over not partying
      with him. But it was hard. I kept remembering Jason climbing behind the wheel
      of the swather. “Look,” I said. “Whatever.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You have <i>grasshoppers</i>?”
      Jason sounded genuinely envious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I was going to surprise you.
      But, whatever.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shit,” he said wistfully. “I haven’t had grasshoppers
      since before the plague. Where’d you get grasshoppers?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I knew
      this guy at the trucking company who used to come in from Denver,” I lied. “How
      does it matter now? I’m so fucking bored, Jason. Seriously. My whole family’s
      cut me off. And now Morgan’s gone, so I don’t even have her. You heard about
      Morgan, right?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yeah, I heard.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said this with
      utter disinterest. He was so gross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,” I said. “I’ll just
      have to find somebody else to party with. Now that you’re out, ass hole.” I
      knew I had to try to start flirting with him. “The thing is,” I said, “I’m so
      fucking lonely, right <i>now</i>. I can’t believe you stood me up. You <i>owe</i>
      me. You know? You owe me at least just one night. Honestly, I’ve been wanting
      you to fuck me ever since that night at the fairgrounds. Can you really not
      get away? I thought you were the <i>sergeant</i>. I thought you didn’t answer
      to anybody. Was that really all bullshit? I should have known you’d pussy out.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      <i>am</i> the sergeant,” Jason insisted idiotically. He actually sounded hurt.
      He was also starting to sound a little tempted. “It’s just dangerous, that’s
      all,” he whispered. “I mean, we’d have to be really, really careful. Honestly,
      I’ve been thinking about you. You have no idea how bad I want to fuck you, Ashley!”
      He laughed. “I really regretted not being able to make it last night.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      couldn’t believe he was already taking the bait. All I had to do was question
      his masculinity, and I could get him to do anything. This actually had the effect
      of making me hate him even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, where’s a safe place?”
      I asked cautiously. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t know. Like, a field. Someplace way
      out in the middle of nowhere. Someplace where I could be sure <i>no one</i>
      else was around to report me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I know a place,” I said. “But
      look, if you don’t show up again I’m finding somebody else. You have no idea
      how many of these rangers from outside have been coming on to me. I’ll be behind
      the fairgrounds tonight just after sunset. There’s a cottonwood tree in the
      middle of the first field behind the rodeo grandstands. I’ll be there. Come
      find me. You know where I mean?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yeah, I know where you mean,”
      he said tentatively. “Look, Ash. If we do this we have to be really careful.
      We’re totally out of Insta-Reads, so I can’t test you. We <i>have</i> to use
      protection. Okay?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I laughed. “Whatever you say, Sergeant. I’ll
      bring a pocket full of rubbers with your name on all of them. Don’t worry about
      it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“And you still have the grasshoppers?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      fucking bet I do,” I said. “Don’t be late. I swear to God this is your last
      fucking chance, Jason. Don’t pussy out on me again.”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">J</span>ason wasn’t late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d
      spent the rest of the day walking all the way to the fairgrounds. I’d reached
      the field behind the grandstands just before sunset. I’d sat against the cottonwood
      tree and waited in the last of the light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as soon as it was
      dark, Jason drove up alone in a small military SUV. As soon as he turned into
      the field, he cut off his lights and slowly drove toward the cottonwood tree
      in the dark. He was being extra careful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Get in,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Where
      are we going?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just get in.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I climbed in. Without
      ever turning the headlights on, Jason slowly drove along an irrigation channel
      until we were four fields away from the fairgrounds. I could barely see the
      lights of town. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He cut the engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment
      he just sat there in the dark, not moving or saying anything. He wasn’t comfortable
      with this. He was nervous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I reached into my pocket and took out
      one of the condoms. I slipped it into his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, Mister
      Safety First,” I said. “What are you waiting for?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He took the
      condom. He shined a tiny flashlight into my face, then he turned it off again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This
      is crazy doing this without testing you,” he said. “But you look pretty good.
      You don’t <i>look</i> infected. I guess we’ll be okay with just the rubber.
      I guess.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I leaned close to him and whispered softly into his
      ear. “Since when were you the worrying type, Sergeant.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I gently
      bit his earlobe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Jesus <i>Christ</i>,” he whispered. He took
      a deep breath and sighed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He reached into the back and grabbed
      what I could just make out in the dark to be a pint of vodka. He opened it,
      took a drink, and handed it over to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before taking the bottle,
      I reached into my left pants pocket and took out the pill Chris had given me
      with the sedatives. I’d taken both pills out of the latex, making sure to keep
      the sedative in my left pocket and the sugar pill in my right pocket. I slipped
      the sedative into Jason’s hand and took the vodka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I can’t believe
      you have grasshoppers,” he said. He finally seemed to be relaxing a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,
      they’re the last of my stash. So you better fucking enjoy it, Mister.” I took
      the sugar pill from my pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason flashed his flashlight at
      me again. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I could stop him, he took the sugar pill from
      my hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You sure these are grasshoppers?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Shit</i>.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I kept my eye on the sugar pill. The capsule was identical to
      the sedative, and now the two pills lay side by side in his hand. I couldn’t
      mix them up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Of course they’re fucking grasshoppers.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      reached to take the sugar pill back, but Jason pulled away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hold
      this.” He handed me the flashlight. “Keep it down. Don’t shine it out the window.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      cupped the flashlight and kept it pointed at his hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just
      in case you’re trying to poison me or something,” he said, uncapping both pills.
      “Can’t be too careful.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He dumped the powder from both pills into
      his palm, mixed all of it together, then scooped half into one capsule, half
      into the other, and capped them both. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the capsules had half
      of a sedative dose each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fuck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fuck, fuck, <i>fuck</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Here.”
      Jason handed me one of the pills. “You first.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was totally fucked.
      I was much smaller than Jason, and if I took even half a dose of the powerful
      sedative, I’d almost certainly pass out first. But what could I do? I had no
      choice. I’d have to take the pill and somehow try to get the card from him as
      fast as I could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tossed the pill into my mouth and swallowed
      it down with a swig of vodka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What had I gotten myself into?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      <i>knew</i> you liked to party!” Jason enthusiastically popped his own pill,
      sipped the vodka, and swallowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly he was all over me.
      He shoved his hand into my bra and started kissing me hard. His teeth knocked
      against mine. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did my best to kill as much time as possible.
      I tried to get into the back of the SUV, saying we’d have more room, and then
      I tried to stall after stepping outside. The only chance I had was to wait for
      the sedatives to kick in, then force myself to stay alert long enough to get
      into Jason’s wallet. After that, I had no idea what I was going to do. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      instead of following me into the back seat, Jason stepped around the SUV and
      grabbed me. He pulled me up onto its hood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He tore my shirt open,
      ripping off all the buttons, and instead of waiting for me to take the shirt
      all the way off, he jerked at the back of Morgan’s threadbare flannel and tore
      it in half from the tail to the collar. He flung away the two pieces and started
      frantically licking my breasts, pulling my bra down over my shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Jesus
      fucking Christ,” I said, already feeling a little woozy from the sedative. “Slow
      down.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What do you mean slow down?” Jason said, breathing hard
      and unbuckling his belt. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I knew it, he had my pants off,
      and he’d slapped on the condom, and he was inside me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The worst
      part was that he was actually really big. It hurt. I fucking hated him. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Jason!
      Hold on! <i>Slow down</i>!” I was terrified. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he didn’t stop.
      He started pounding into me. I tried to act like I liked it, but it was really
      hard to be convincing with my back against the hood. He was really hurting me.
      I hadn’t ever planned on actually having sex with him. I’d hoped to bide my
      time until the sedatives kicked in. But he’d moved so fast, and now I had no
      choice ifI ever wanted to get the access card. He started squeezing my breasts
      with all of his weight on top of me, grunting. It was like he’d gone into this
      blank place where he didn’t see me as a human being at all, but as just some
      object for him to squeeze to the point of suffocation and ram his cock into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tried to remind myself that <i>I</i> was the one who had power over him, that
      his dumb, violent urge to fuck me hard was his weakness, and that if I just
      waited him out and kept myself alert long enough, I’d get the better of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still,
      it’s hard to describe how much I hated him while he had me pinned down like
      that, grunting into my ear, slamming himself inside me like a crazed bull. He
      had complete control over me. I’d never felt so tiny and helpless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Stop!”
      I screamed, finally. “Jason! Stop!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought I was going to die
      out of sheer panic and terror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the sudden, Jason’s frantic
      thrusts slowed. But not because I’d told him to stop. He slumped a little, dazed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      groaned. “Fucking, Ashley,” he slurred into my ear. “This <i>grasshopper</i>.
      Is some <i>gyood</i> <i>shyit</i>. Best I <i>everrrrrr had</i>. . .”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      sedative was finally kicking in. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pushed him off me, and he
      woozily let me roll him over onto his back. His legs dangled against the SUV’s
      bumper. His head lolled back against the windshield. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He gave
      me this idiotic grin which I could just make out in the dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Wowww,</i>”
      he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was all I could do not to tip over and fall off the
      hood myself. I was finding it almost impossible to keep my balance. The sedative
      had started affecting me too, and it was coming on strong now. I felt my weight
      pitch forward, but I caught myself against Jason’s chest and found my balance.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took a deep breath. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment all I could
      do was stare at Jason’s grin, blinking my eyes. I stepped away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fucking
      <i>cunt</i>,” he slurred, almost as if talking in his sleep. “Put me back <i>insyide</i>
      <i>you</i>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why would anyone ever say something like that? Even
      while drugged? Jason had been a spoiled, horrible kid when I’d babysat him,
      and now he’d grown up into a spoiled, horrible asshole of a human being. He
      wasn’t even infected, and he still acted this way. It was just how he was. Another
      wave of hatred passed over me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, strangely, I felt suddenly
      alert. My heart raced, and I was overcome with the same weird feeling of limitless
      confidence I’d had after waking up in the motel room more a than week earlier.
      My anger and hatred for Jason seemed to have triggered the feeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      could barely see in the dark, but I found my pants where Jason had tossed them.
      Instead of putting them on, though, with my ears ringing with rage, I searched
      the pockets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right away I found what I was looking for. It was
      still there. Right alongside my Dad’s topo map, I felt a long, smooth cylinder
      about the size of a pencil. I grabbed it and jerked it free of my pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was the knitting needle I’d killed Morgan with. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the dim starlight,
      I could see that it was still slicked with her blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason grunted
      and lifted his arm toward me, but he dropped it back down against the hood and
      rolled over, face down, with a dull thump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<i>Byiiitch</i>,”
      he droned woozily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My heart thudded with yet another surge of
      hateful energy. Jason’s bare, pale ass lay exposed after he’d rolled over on
      the hood. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without fully thinking through what I was doing, I
      stepped forward. I thought about how Jason had executed that poor girl in the
      car, about his smug grin while driving the swather, and about how heartlessly
      he’d just stuffed himself inside me and groped me to the point where I couldn’t
      breathe. I would have killed him if I could have. But even more than I wanted
      Jason dead, I wanted him to suffer horribly, like Bryce and Morgan had. I wanted
      to make him sick. Then I wanted his superiors in the Home Guard to recognize
      his symptoms, execute him on the spot, and put his body on display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With
      a quick thrust, I shoved the bloody knitting needle up Jason’s ass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      jammed it in as deep as I could. I twisted it, then jammed it in even further.
      I felt his intestines tearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason writhed around in furious
      pain. He let out a low howl that sounded like a rutting buck. He took an unsteady
      swing at me, but I leapt back and he missed connecting with my jaw. Instead,
      he lost his balance, fell off the SUV’s hood, and landed with a dull thud on
      the ground. I heard the knitting needle break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He groaned. His
      head rolled around, but he didn’t even try to get up. The sedatives had almost
      knocked him out completely. He was only half conscious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stepped
      farther away and tried to catch my breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t believe
      what I’d just done. It was like waking up from a dream. I’d just wasted so much
      time, lost in my spite for Jason. And no matter how strangely aware I’d felt
      a moment ago, I was bound to pass out from the pill soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And
      now that I’d caught my breath, the sedatives were hitting me hard. The one thing
      I could absolutely not let myself do was to collapse in this empty field and
      wake up in the morning beside Jason, just as he himself would be rousing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      had to move fast. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knelt and fished Jason’s wallet from his
      back pocket. I clutched it tightly in my hand, willing myself not to drop it.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried to stand, but I fell backwards, scraping my bare behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      picked up my pants, but no matter how hard I tried, I was too woozy now to put
      my foot inside them. The burst of energy and the clarity I’d gotten before was
      totally gone. I was about to pass out. I had no choice but to leave my clothes
      behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to get as far away from Jason as I could before
      I lost consciousness. The night was quickly closing in on me. The world was
      spinning. I grabbed half of Morgan’s torn shirt and my dad’s map in one hand,
      and Jason’s wallet in the other. I squeezed them both tightly in my fists. I
      willed myself to stand. Finally I found my feet, wobbling unsteadily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And
      I ran. I ran as fast as I could.</p>\r\n</div>"

    - "<div class=\"blog_text\"><p>So, when I was drafting Part 6, I was really nervous
      about writing the scene with Ashley and Jason on the SUV. But I knew I just
      had to write it, and I knew it would have to be a difficult and brutal scene,
      and, most of all, I knew Ashley had to find a strength she never knew she had.
      Even if her new confidence allows her to do a lot of selfless good, at the same
      time it makes her capable of committing a lot of selfish vengeance too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway,
      if you want to find out why Ashley is changing in the way she is, and what will
      happen as a result, keep reading!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I said I was nervous about writing
      the SUV scene, but I’ve also been nervous about a lot of other things these
      past few days. First of all, I was nervous when I finally wrote to Kyle and
      told him it was going to be impossible for me to talk to him, that it probably
      wasn’t going to work out between us, and that he should probably find somebody
      else. And then I was nervous when he didn’t write back for two days. And then
      I was <i>really</i> nervous about things when he finally <i>did</i> write to
      me. I still am. But I'll get to that in a second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is,
      Kyle is graduating early. He actually finished all of his courses last semester,
      and he doesn’t have to go to school at all until he starts college in California.
      He already knows he got into a really good school out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      he finally wrote back to me, he told me he’s planning a road trip to California.
      Like, right away. And he wants me to go with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I kind of
      told him I would seriously consider it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m so tired of being
      stuck here with my dad. Sometimes I feel like I’m just fading away from existence,
      sitting here on my bed all day. My doctor would definitely say I’m crazy for
      even considering a road trip, but it’s not like he could stop me. And since
      I haven’t been able to attend school anyway this year, I’m already getting all
      my homework online from my teachers. I don’t see why I couldn’t keep up with
      school in California, just like I’m doing here. I even have a little bit of
      money in an account from when my grandmother died. It’s not much, but it’ll
      get me by until I maybe take a job waitressing or something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      haven’t told Kyle definitely yes yet. I’m so excited and terrified at the thought
      of just getting into his car and driving to California. But, honestly, I <i>really</i>
      want to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">xxBailey</p>\r\n</div>"

    - "<div class=\"novel_text\"><p><span class=\"first_letter\">I</span> woke up
      to the sound of clucking chickens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was morning. My head was
      still so foggy from the sedatives I could hardly lift it to get a good look
      around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was in the chicken stall at the fairgrounds. The rows
      of cages were still filled with birds that had been entered into the now-abandoned
      fair. They were starving, and molting. Some were dead. I was covered in loose
      hay and feathers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somehow, I was still holding on to half of
      Morgan’s flannel shirt, my dad’s map, and Jason’s wallet. I forced myself to
      sit up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no memory of making it as far as the fairgrounds
      before passing out. I was still naked. My bare feet were cut and covered in
      dried blood. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I opened Jason’s wallet. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I threw
      out a debit card and some kind of Home Guard mess hall card. And then there
      it was. A simple white card with a magnetic strip, the words “Pharmaceutical
      Access,” and a warning that finding it and not returning it to the Home Guard
      was a crime punishable by indefinite detention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I kept the card
      and tossed Jason’s wallet into one of the chicken cages. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt
      inside the breast pocket of what was left of Morgan’s flannel. The single quarter
      I’d saved was still inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I crept from the chicken stall out
      into the sun. The morning was surprisingly warm after a cold night. The fairgrounds
      were totally abandoned, and for a moment I just let the sunlight fall onto my
      naked body. I was still feeling pretty woozy, but I could feel some of my energy
      starting to return. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked out toward the fields stretching
      away from the chicken stall. As far as I could see, Jason’s SUV was gone. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      fairgrounds, luckily, were filled with pay phones. The nearest was just across
      the roadway beside the horse stables. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d torn up Chris’s letter
      after memorizing his number, but I was able to clear the cobwebs from my head
      just enough to remember the digits as I deposited the quarter. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      picked up right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Please tell me this is Ashley,” he said.
      He must not have recognized the incoming number and hoped it was a pay phone.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I got it,” I said. I told him where I was and asked him to pick
      me up. “Bring me some clothes, will you?” I added. “Don’t ask. It’s a long story.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While
      I waited for Chris, I found a relatively concealed place in the sun behind a
      wooden barrel that had been converted into a flowerpot. I listened to the horses
      in their stalls, whinnying loudly. Poor things. They probably hadn’t a heard
      a human voice for days, and they were probably starving. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A car
      approached. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ducked down behind the flowerpot and peered over
      its arrangement of dead pansies. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A hearse, covered in dust, pulled
      up in front of the stables. It came to a stop by the pay phone. Its engine cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      stepped out. He was in a white Home Guard uniform and a lab coat with two armbands,
      one with a black <i>HG</i> logo and the other with a red cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why
      was he driving a hearse?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Don’t ask about the car and I won’t
      ask about the clothes,” Chris said, tossing a small duffel bag behind the flowerpot.
      It landed by my bloodied foot. I unzipped it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Scrubs?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What
      else?” Chris looked away while I put on the faded blue hospital clothing he’d
      brought me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked like a mental patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now
      that I was clothed, Chris walked straight over and gave me a big hug. “You are
      fucking amazing, Ashley,” he said. “Fucking amazing!” he yelled out. “Let me
      see it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I gave him the access card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fucking incredible.”
      He was elated. “I didn’t even think you’d get my note. How did you <i>do</i>
      it? Did you give him the sedative?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Sort of.” I shrugged. “Seriously,
      don’t ask.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Do you think he knows you took the card?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      think he knows his whole wallet’s missing.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shit,” Chris said.
      “We don’t have much time then. Let’s go.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just a minute.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      hurried into the stables. Thirty or forty horses, all in their own stalls, pranced
      and snorted when I came in. They weren’t in as bad shape as the chickens, but
      they’d eaten through all of their feed, not to mention all of the hay on the
      stable floor. The water in their shared trough was down to a muddy puddle. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      turned on the trough faucet and started emptying sacks of oats into the feeding
      bins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Seriously?” Chris called out when he saw what I was doing.
      “We seriously don’t have time for this. We have to go!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’ll
      thank me later,” I said. “I promise.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When all of the horses had
      been fed and the trough was full, I turned off the water and got into the hearse
      with Chris. I was glad to see it wasn’t carrying a coffin. The engine was already
      running. As soon as I closed the door, Chris put the clutch in gear and sped
      forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Can I really not ask about the hearse?” I asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      shrugged. “Well, it’s the best way not to get stopped and searched at a check
      point,” he explained. “Most of the rangers on guard duty are the young ones,
      and they’re all freaked out by coffins with people inside screaming to be let
      out. Understandably. They’d rather just pretend this kind of thing isn’t happening.
      So most of the guards just wave hearses through.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tried not
      to think about how many people must have been buried alive right then. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      pulled out onto the highway and headed straight toward the center of town. One
      Home Guard squad was standing around a fire in the supermarket parking lot,
      warming ration packets on the flames, but they didn’t pay us any attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      just really hope this uniform passes at the pharmacy.” Chris patted the <i>HG</i>
      logo on his armband. “I’m on the wanted list, but I’m hoping they won’t pay
      much attention to me if I’m wearing my old stuff.” He took a deep breath. I
      didn’t realize until now how scared he was. “We’ll see” he said, exhaling. “Fingers
      crossed.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hadn’t expected that actually getting in would be
      a problem once we had the access card. Somehow, stupidly, I’d imagined that
      Chris would be able to just swipe the card, waltz right in, and take whatever
      he needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Is the pharmacy pretty well guarded?” I asked. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      laughed hollowly. “Even with that steel door they put in, they’ve started stationing
      an entire squad there. All kinds of meds are in short supply, from ibuprofen
      to chemo agents to TGV test applicators. And the Home Guard <i>really</i> doesn’t
      want people getting their hands on any antibiotics.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t
      get it,” I said. “Isn’t the whole purpose of the Home Guard’s existence to eradicate
      the pathogen in the quarantine zone? Shouldn’t they <i>want</i> people to have
      access to antibiotics if it fights the disease?” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Not when the
      cocktail doesn’t actually <i>weaken</i> the parasite.” Chris glanced at me sardonically.
      “Guess we didn’t tell you that little detail, did we? When I was testing the
      cocktail months ago on earlier strains, before we really knew what this thing
      was, we found out that it actually <i>strengthens</i> the parasite. It ends
      up selecting for stronger, longer-living larvae as the species adapts and becomes
      resistant to the antibiotics. It becomes a superbug. The longer the parasite
      lives, the longer the host stays viable, and the slower the disease’s stages
      progress. With the right antibiotics, you could keep people in stage one for
      months, maybe even longer, someday. But that would mean giving the host a longer
      period of time to spread the pathogen on to someone else. The Home Guard just
      wants to wipe the whole thing out.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That’s why they’re only really
      interested in shooting people? Or burying them alive?” Suddenly I understood.
      “They don’t care about curing anyone.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There is no cure,” Chris
      said somberly. “You can slow the disease, but only by strengthening it. You
      can’t cure it, ever.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He reached into the back of the hearse and
      handed me a shotgun. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s all I have,” he said. “I hope you
      won’t need it, but keep the safety off.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I noticed Chris was wearing
      his pistol under his lab coat. I held the shotgun low and kept it pointed at
      the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">J</span>Chris
      hadn’t been kidding about the guards at the pharmacy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>An entire
      squad of six rangers, complete with a large armored vehicle, was stationed at
      the entrance. It was hard to imagine this was the same place my mom used to
      buy me cough syrup when I was a kid. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we even began to
      slow down, the squad’s sergeant, a stout, brawny guy I’d never seen before,
      waved at us to stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So much for Chris’s hearse strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      pulled over on the opposite side of the road and parked beside the Bronze Dragon,
      Muldoon’s single Chinese food restaurant. Both the restaurant and the apartment
      above were now abandoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Papers?” the sergeant called out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None
      of the rangers seemed too concerned about us. Most of them were leaning against
      the armored vehicle, looking bored, their guns slung over their shoulders. They
      stirred only to push forward a very young private, obviously new to the squad,
      to examine our papers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This one’s all yours.” One of the rangers
      nudged the private forward with his boot on his backside. “A girl and a fairy.
      You can handle it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Get her number,” another ranger said mockingly.
      “<i>Hers</i>, not his.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the rangers laughed. The young
      private nervously crossed the road to approach us and examine our papers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      problem was, of course, not only did neither of us have travel clearance, both
      of us were wanted. We had a pharmacy access card, but what good was that going
      to do if we didn’t have any clearance papers? Obviously, Chris hadn’t anticipated
      this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Fuck,” he whispered, eyeing the approaching private. He
      had no idea what to do. He leaned back and put his hand on his head, helpless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      had to do something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I reached into his lab coat and grabbed his
      pistol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What are you—?” Chris began, startled. “Ashley!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      tucked the pistol into the back of the scrubs I was wearing and got out of the
      hearse. I walked directly toward the private.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn’t even sure
      what I was doing. I wasn’t even wearing shoes. But suddenly I was overcome by
      another weird rush of what felt like limitless confidence. The fog from my sedative
      hangover cleared away. I had no idea where these spikes of nerve were coming
      from, but when they hit me I was strangely, recklessly, without any fear at
      all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The private was very young. I met him in the middle of the
      road. We stopped on opposite sides of the road’s yellow line. He couldn’t have
      been a day over eighteen. He was gawky, with a plump, pink zit on his cheek.
      He was obviously nervous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Your papers, ma’am?” he asked politely,
      avoiding my gaze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought about Morgan. I thought about the
      young girl with the vacant green eyes who had passed me on the highway. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What
      would you do to me, Private,” I asked quietly, “if I was positive?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just
      your travel papers ma’am,” he mumbled. “Then you can be on your way.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      didn’t answer my question,” I said. “What would you do?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The private’s
      face was flushing deeply now. I was staring right at him, practically breathing
      on him, and he still refused to meet my eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My sergeant’s orders
      are to shoot any known or suspected positives on sight,” he recited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Shit,
      Gomer! I think she’s kind of into you!” one of the rangers called out. “Work
      your Gomer magic! Maybe you’ll get a hand job out of it!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      squad laughed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I didn’t ask you what your orders are,” I said
      softly. “This is a test, Gomer. Your answer’s important. What would <i>you</i>
      do if I was positive?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yes, ma’am. I would shoot you,” he said
      briskly, as if speaking to a superior officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You sure about
      that?” I asked. “Is that your final answer?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yes, ma’am,” he
      stammered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Do you know what I’m going to do?” I whispered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Show
      me your travel papers? Ma’am?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“No. I’m going to shoot you. Right
      in the chest.” I gently tapped his chest. “Not because I have any orders. But
      because it’s just the <i>right thing to do</i>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The private stared
      at me dumbly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled Chris’s pistol from my scrubs, jammed it
      into the private’s chest, and pulled the trigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sound of
      the gunshot exploded across the quiet street. The private stumbled backwards,
      gasping, tugging at his bulletproof vest. As quickly as I could, I pulled the
      semi-automatic rifle from his shoulder and started firing at the squad. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>None
      of the rangers expected this. Their faces fell as they scrambled to shoulder
      their guns and take a position behind the armored vehicle. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      didn’t expect the private’s rifle to be so powerful. Every time I pulled the
      trigger, the stock leapt up and bit painfully into my shoulder. All of my shots
      sailed way too high as a result, but it was enough to scare the squad and buy
      a little time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I raced back to the hearse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      was baffled and terrified. “What the fuck, Ashley!” he kept saying. “What the
      <i>fuck!</i>”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled him behind the hearse. Luckily, Chris had
      the presence of mind to grab the shotgun. As soon as we hit the ground, a barrage
      of bullets slammed into the hearse’s body and shattered its windows. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      the first volley let up, I fired back. I couldn’t even begin to hope to hit
      any of the rangers with the unwieldy weapon. I just wanted to give us enough
      cover to fall back into the Bronze Dragon. I pulled Chris with me, fired one
      shot into the restaurant’s glass front door, and we both ran through the frame
      and took cover behind the register stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another volley of bullets
      shattered the front windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What the <i>fuck</i> are you doing!”
      Chris was incensed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Making it up as I go!” I shouted back. “What
      the fuck are <i>you</i> doing? Let me fucking know if you have any <i>better</i>
      ideas.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I slipped back into the restaurant kitchen, dragging Chris
      after me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This way.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A stairway lead to the second-story
      apartment. I scrambled up and found the living room, which looked over the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      could see the rangers trying to position themselves. They were still in confusion
      after the unexpected attack. I’d caught them totally off guard. I doubt they’d
      ever been attacked before. The young private I’d shot in the chest was still
      squirming in the road. I’d fired the pistol so close to his vest, I’d probably
      broken most of his ribs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I grabbed Chris’s shotgun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Give
      me this.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stepped back from the window and took aim directly
      at the squad’s brawny sergeant. He was still standing across the road, exposed
      in front of the armored vehicle, waving at his men to take positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      fired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The living room window exploded into thousands of tiny
      shards. The sergeant fell backwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew the shot wouldn’t
      kill the brawny sergeant. But I’d been duck hunting with my Dad enough to know
      that the spread of the shell’s pellets at this distance would be wide enough
      to pepper him from head to foot. The sergeant tried to pull himself to his feet.
      Already I could see that he was bleeding from his arms and his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      fired again. This time I hit one of the rangers side-on. A concentration of
      pellets ripped into his elbow. He cried out and clutched at his arm. Blood fell
      and splashed onto the pavement like spilled coffee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could see
      the wounded sergeant calling out to his men to fall back into the armored vehicles.
      A couple of rangers ran out into the road and dragged the fallen private, who
      looked like he’d lost consciousness. I didn’t fire. The squad knew they’d been
      outmaneuvered. They couldn’t stay in the street while I was in an upstairs window
      with plenty of ammunition. They all scrambled into the vehicle. Then they sped
      away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I knew that many, many reinforcements were bound to
      arrive in minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, though, the pharmacy was totally unguarded.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Let’s go,” I said to Chris. “We have to hurry.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      raced downstairs and across the street. The electronic metal door that the Home
      Guard had installed at the pharmacy had a simple card scanner, just like an
      ATM machine. Chris slid in Jason’s access card and jerked it out. The door instantly
      opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rushed inside. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I drew my pistol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      don’t know what I expected to find, but the pharmacy looked basically like it
      had always looked before the quarantine. Tim Huckabee was even behind the counter,
      the only pharmacist I ever remembered working there. He had to be at least in
      his seventies. The only difference now was that he was wearing a white Home
      Guard medical uniform a lot like Chris’s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn’t even recognize
      me. But I doubt I would have recognized myself. I probably looked absolutely
      insane climbing up on top of the counter in scrubs and with bare, scratched
      feet, waving a pistol in his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had no idea what I was doing.
      All I could think about was every bank robbery I’d ever seen in a movie. The
      robbers almost always jumped up on top of the counter and started screaming
      aggressive orders. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What else was I supposed to do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Antibiotics
      and TGV tests!” I screamed. “Where the <i>fuck</i> are they?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tim
      Huckabee went pale. He held his hands up and backed into a case of vitamin bottles,
      toppling half of them on to the floor. He looking like he thought I was going
      to shoot him any second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley!” Chris said. “They’re here!
      I <i>know</i> where the antibiotics are kept!” He was already in the back of
      the pharmacy, stuffing plastic shopping bags with boxes of antibiotics and other
      medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I jammed the pistol into Tim Huckabee’s face. He
      whimpered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Test applicators!” I yelled. “Where are the test applicators?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      gingerly pointed a gnarled, arthritic finger at a safe beneath the register.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Open
      it!” I screamed, pressing the pistol’s barrel against his cheek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      sobbed. Then he bent over and threw up. I felt splashes of vomit reach my bare
      feet. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then he fell forward and passed out cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shit.
      I’d overdone it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You have to <i>chill out</i>, Ashley,” Chris
      called from behind my shoulder. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I nudged Tim Huckabee’s limp
      body with my foot. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no way he was going to revive in
      time to open the safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked at Chris. “Now what?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,
      I have a fucking lifetime supply of contraband antibiotics.” He was holding
      at least ten plastic bags, each stuffed to bursting. “So not bad. And I found
      <i>one</i> TGV Insta-Read test.” He tossed me the test, still wrapped in plastic.
      “That’ll have to be good enough for now. Let’s not press our luck.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      nodded. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took half of the plastic bags from Chris as we hurried
      from the pharmacy and back out onto the street. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sirens were blaring
      in the distance. The Home Guard was on its way. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hearse was
      riddled with bullet holes. Both of the front tires were flat. Gas was leaking
      away onto the pavement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What the fuck are we going to do?” Chris
      was panicking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sirens were growing louder. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s
      better we’re not in the hearse anyway,” I said, which was actually probably
      true. “We’d just stand out. Follow me.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hurried into the back
      alleyway behind the Bronze Dragon. My bare feet, already lacerated, were practically
      completely raw, but I tried to ignore the pain as I stepped around trash and
      broken bottles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Where are you hiding the refugees?” I asked Chris,
      trying to figure out what to do next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“With the Underground,”
      he said. “Which means they’re all over the place. They’re with people who are
      secretly sympathetic, and willing to resist the Home Guard. They’re in basements
      and attics all over the quarantine zone. But it won’t last long. No one’s willing
      to shelter anyone for more than a few days. Everyone’s afraid of the Home Guard
      cracking down. They’re starting to search properties. A few of the refugees
      are with your boss, actually. Your old boss.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Bill’s sheltering
      refugees?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This actually didn’t surprise me. My boss at the trucking
      company, Bill Hernandez, lived outside of town on an acre of land at the foothills
      of the mountains. He definitely wasn’t the type to sympathize with the Home
      Guard’s tactics. His place was maybe four or five miles away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Bill
      actually kind of started the whole thing,” Chris said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“His place
      is good enough for me.” I picked up my pace while we made our way from the alleyway
      to the back of the high school. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If that’s where we’re going,
      we’re going the wrong way,” Chris stopped. “You know that right?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But
      I didn’t stop trotting through the empty lot behind the high school baseball
      field. The sirens had grown even louder. The Home Guard had probably reached
      the pharmacy by now. I didn’t think anyone was following us, but we had to move
      fast. Chris jogged to catch up. I could see the abandoned carnival rides rising
      up just beyond the high school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just follow me,” I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">B</span>y the time we reached the fairgrounds,
      I couldn’t hear the sirens anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I opened the door to
      the stables, the horses started whinnying and prancing. Now that they’d been
      watered and fed, they were full of energy and wanted to get out of the stalls
      they’d been stuck standing in for almost two weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I found Kaypay,
      my sister’s horse, near the end of one of the stable rows. I rubbed my hand
      along her nose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ready to go for a ride?” I whispered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      horse stamped her hooves. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I don’t know how to ride a horse,”
      Chris said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You don’t have to know how. You just have to hang
      on.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I lead Kaypay and seven other horses out of their stalls
      and tethered them all together with a long rope. I could only find five dusty
      saddles in the tack room, but I brushed them off and put them on the five lead
      horses. I secured the bags of antibiotics to one, and helped Chris climb atop
      another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I climbed onto Kaypay in the front of the line and tapped
      her sides with my bare heels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Don’t fall off,” I called back
      to Chris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaypay wanted to trot, but I kept her from going too
      fast. With all of the horses tethered together, we’d have to take it slow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      lead the procession through the fairgrounds and toward the fields in the back.
      There was a dirt road that lead all the way through the fields to the foothills
      of the Rockies. By following it, I was pretty sure I’d be able to find Bill
      Hernandez’s house while still avoiding all the main roads where the Home Guard
      would be patrolling.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">W</span>e
      reached Bill’s place in just over an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill’s property was
      filled with big rigs. They all must have been out of operation since the quarantine
      began. There was also a big warehouse-style motor shop at the head of the driveway,
      and behind it was the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill was really happy to see me.
      He came out in the felt cowboy hat he always wore, smiling, holding his arms
      open. Honestly, I hadn’t thought about Bill much since everything had happened,
      but he had always been a good boss, and we’d always gotten along. He gave me
      a big hug when I slid off the horse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Ashley!” He looked me over.
      “My oh my! I wasn’t sure if I’d ever see you again. Chris told me you were missing,
      and it just about broke my heart. Thank God you’re okay.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We
      brought goodies.” Chris started untying the plastic bags filled with antibiotics
      from the saddle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’re kidding me!” Bill smiled, smoothing his
      mustache. “Is that what I think it is? So much! How the hell’d you get all that?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Illegally,”
      Chris laughed. “Very illegally.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My oh my.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      have Ashley to thank for all this. All of it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill smiled at
      me. “Well, somehow that doesn’t surprise me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was actually feeling
      a little bit good for the first time in a very long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While
      Bill helped us hide the horses in the motor shop, Chris told me that it was
      actually Bill who first started calling the resistance the <i>Underground</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“After
      that,” Chris explained, “people who needed help started showing up. Bill was
      the one who started feeling other people out who might be willing to shelter
      positives from the Home Guard. He’s been able to find—what? Five or six households
      now?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill nodded. “They’re good people. But they sure are scared.
      The Home Guard’s getting more and more nosey.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Bill won’t say
      who’s doing the sheltering,” Chris explained. “He won’t even tell me. But it’s
      probably not a bad idea to keep it all as secret as possible.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After
      securing the horses, we shut the motor shop’s large double doors and Bill led
      us to the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Come and have some lunch,” he said. “You two
      must be starving.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing could have been truer. I was famished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      couldn’t believe it, but Bill actually made us steaks. Nothing had ever tasted
      better in my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we ate, I told Bill about the cliff dwellings
      that my dad and I had discovered years ago. It was the first time I’d ever spoken
      about them with anybody but my Dad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I can’t imagine a safer place
      to shelter refugees,” I said. “It won’t be easy getting provisions out there,
      and the weather’s going to get cold, but if we can make it work, it would be
      almost impossible for the Home Guard to find a hideout like that for a long
      time.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well, sounds like it’s better than anything else we got
      now.” Bill offered me a second steak. “You sure you can find it?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      nodded. “I’m sure. It might take two or three days on horseback, but I can find
      it. My dad marked it on a topo map for me. And I’m going. I’ve decided. Any
      of the refugees who are willing to make the journey can come.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After
      lunch, Bill virtually emptied his pantry, filling duffel bags and suitcases
      with rice and beans and canned food. He gave me four sleeping bags and rolled
      up another eight or nine blankets from his closet. He even insisted we take
      every box of shotgun shells he owned. We secured all of these provisions and
      tied them under tarps onto three of the horse’s backs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This won’t
      last long,” Bill said. “We’ll work on getting more provisions soon.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then
      he shut himself away in a cluttered spare room to call all of the members of
      the Underground who were sheltering positives, asking them to pass word to the
      refugees to gather at his house if they wanted to go with me to hide in a remote
      location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Tell them that if they want to come, it’s going to
      be rough out there,” I said, before Bill closed the door. “No electricity, running
      water. None of that. We’ll have shelter and plenty of antibiotics, at least.
      But they’ll have to be blindfolded on the way out. Tell them that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill
      nodded. “That’s probably a good idea. I understand the blindfolds. I’ll tell
      them. And it’ll be their choice whether to go.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shut the door
      and started making the calls.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">J</span>Chris
      had emptied all of the boxes of antibiotics onto Bill’s kitchen table. He had
      taken many of the pills from the foil trays, sorted them in piles, and now he
      was using a mortar and pestle to grind and mix them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Next step
      is measuring out the doses and filling the capsules with the powder,” he explained.
      He brushed off his hands. “But first let me have a look at those feet.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      sat at the table beside Chris. “Bill said he’d ask one of the Undergrounders
      to bring me a pair of boots,” I said. “I guess one of them has feet close to
      my size.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You really tore them up, didn’t you? How did you lose
      your <i>shoes</i>?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t answer. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Right,” he
      said. “Don’t ask. Fine.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pulled my feet onto his lap. They
      were filthy. Most of the dried blood had worn off, but now all of the cuts were
      filled with dirt and grime. Chris started washing the cuts out with a disinfectant
      pad. I winced whenever he cleaned out a particularly deep cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So
      what about you? Are you coming to the cliff dwellings?” I asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      shrugged. “Where else am I going to go? After that crazy shit we pulled at the
      pharmacy today, you and me are probably at the top of the Home Guard’s most-wanted
      list. I can’t stick around here. I guess you’ll have to give me horseback lessons.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      was relieved to hear this. I didn’t want to have the responsibility of bringing
      a whole group of infected refugees way out to the middle of nowhere alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Normally
      this wouldn’t be any of my business,” Chris said quietly. “But is it true that
      you, uh, slept with Bryce Tripp . . . ?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn’t blame Chris
      for worrying that I might be infected. If he was going to be holed up with me
      way out there in the ruins for who knew how long, he had the right to know what
      he was getting into. He also needed to know if he’d need to start me on the
      antibiotic cocktail. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yes,” I said simply. “I slept with him.
      But I didn’t let him… You know. I don’t think I let anything get inside me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      nodded. He didn’t look up from my feet. He opened a plastic bandage and pressed
      it over one of the larger cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I know I can’t know for sure,”
      I added. I was trying to sound brave, or at least detached and clinical about
      the possibility of my being sick. “But I guess I’ll just have to wait. It’s
      been two days since then.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris nodded again. “How do you feel?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,
      I’m not dead yet.” I tried to laugh. “I feel pretty good. Great actually.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was true. Ever since the firefight with the Home Guard, I wasn’t even feeling
      foggy from the sedative hangover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That’s good.” Chris patted
      my foot. He’d finished cleaning out the cuts. He set my feet back down onto
      the floor. “Most people die within twenty-four hours of becoming infected. Some
      have lasted as many as three days, but it’s rare. Never longer than that, though.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      nodded. “Okay,” I said. “Good to know.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d been hoping he was
      going to tell me I was out of the clear after two days, but I’d just have to
      wait another twenty-four hours before I could know for sure that I wasn’t infected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      asked, “Do you still have that Insta-Read test I gave you at the pharmacy?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was still in the pocket of the scrubs I was wearing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Yeah,”
      I answered. “Why?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shrugged. “Why don’t you maybe go test yourself?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      don’t want to waste it,” I said. “I’ll know I’m negative if I last another day
      anyway, won’t I? We might need it later. It’s our only one. And, honestly, I
      don’t even feel sick at all.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’d be better off knowing for
      sure, though. Right? Just in case?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought about this, but
      I shook my head. “No. Really,” I said. “By this point it’s unlikely I’m sick.
      And if I am, there’s nothing I can do about it. Besides, we might need the Insta-Read
      later if we need to find out if one of the refugees has progressed to the next
      stage.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s up to you,” Chris said. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He went back
      to filling the pill capsules, and he didn’t press me any further. I was pretty
      sure now I wasn’t sick, but if Chris was concerned, I couldn’t help worrying
      a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span class=\"new_section_first_letter\">A</span>
      total of nine refugees showed up at Bill’s house, some on foot, others in trunks
      of cars that sped straight away after dropping them off. This number included
      a young couple with an infant, the three of whom Bill had been hiding in his
      hunting shack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My third grade teacher, who had come to the granary,
      was nowhere to be seen. But the Botteroffs were there, quietly hanging on to
      one another, waiting for instruction. The rest were kids, two girls and two
      guys, I guessed ranging in age from sixteen to twenty. I didn’t recognize any
      of them. They looked like maybe they’d been dumped into the quarantine zone
      from some Denver suburb. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right away Chris distributed sandwich
      bags filled with antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Three times a day,” he told everyone.
      “Don’t forget. You’re going to feel fatigued. There’s no way around that. And
      many of you will experience unusually vivid dreams. But for now, this is the
      only way we know how to slow the progression of the disease.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone
      eyed the pills warily, but I didn’t see anyone who chose not to take one. None
      of the refugees looked like they were any later than stage two, and they were
      obviously terrified of moving on to stage three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My plan was to
      ride through the night. Judging by my dad’s map, I thought we’d be able to reach
      the ruins by sunset the next day, if we left right away. We couldn’t afford
      to wait around. Bill said the Home Guard always arrived at his place in the
      evening on residential patrol, and it was already late afternoon. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      kept the horses tethered together, put people two to a horse, and told them
      basically to hold on tight. Nobody was happy when I passed around the blindfolds,
      but Bill gave a little speech and insisted that it was necessary to protect
      the secrecy of the hideout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He handed me a pair of hiking boots,
      only one size too big, and hugged me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Good luck, Ashley. Thank
      you. You’re a saint.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Let’s hope this works out,” I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      and I shared Kaypay. I helped him up onto the saddle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’re going
      to try to come back in a week or so,” Chris told Bill. “Get the word out that
      we’re sheltering positives. Anyone willing to wear a blindfold on the trip out
      is welcome.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I will,” Bill said. “I’ll have a fresh stock of
      provisions. You can count on it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I nudged Kaypay with my heels.
      Chris held on tight behind me. The entire progression of horses, connected by
      a single rope and loaded with provisions, gear, and mounted refugees, followed
      Kaypay’s lead. I waved goodbye to Bill, and we headed toward the mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">T</span>he beginning of the journey was relatively
      easy. The trails weren’t very steep yet and no one had gotten saddle sore. Everyone
      had accepted the necessity of the blindfolds, and people fell into their own
      thoughts as they swayed atop the horses. Few of the refugees said much of anything.
      Even the baby was quiet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the sun set, it was much harder
      to navigate in the dark than I’d thought. We reached what was marked as <i>Pines
      Bluff</i> on my dad’s map after two in the morning. From there, we’d need to
      climb up a steep, winding incline. Chris and I decided to stop and let everyone
      sleep until dawn. No one complained. Everyone was sore and exhausted, but there
      had also been a release of tension as we moved farther into the mountains. The
      refugees had been living in constant fear of being discovered by the Home Guard,
      and now at least people were starting to feel safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I woke everyone
      up at first light. After rolling up my blanket, I made my way into a ravine
      to pee. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I squatted behind a rock, I felt the Insta-Read test
      in my front pocket. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It had been bothering me that Chris had wanted
      me to test myself. I was now basically certain that I hadn’t contracted the
      pathogen, but Chris’s suggestion had planted a doubt that had been nagging me
      all night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I succumbed to the temptation and opened the Insta-Read
      package. If I tested myself now, at least I’d know for sure that I wasn’t sick,
      I could stop being pre-occupied by the nagging worry, and I could concentrate
      on finding the cliff dwellings. Besides, all of the refugees already knew they
      were positive, and Chris already knew he wasn’t. I was the only one who wasn’t
      sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The applicator was exactly the same as the one Morgan had
      used. The same simple instructions for interpreting the results were printed
      on the plastic. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I clicked the button, and the applicator needle
      shot out. I started to pee. I reached between my legs and held the tip into
      my stream of urine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I set the Insta-Read on a rock to wait for
      the result while a pulled up my scrubs and tied the strings at the waist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      result appeared almost immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three blue lines: “<i>Stage
      3 TGV</i>”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something was wrong. It had to be a faulty applicator.
      Even if I <i>was</i> infected, there was no way I could be at stage three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still,
      was I infected? I’d hoped to set my mind at ease by seeing once and for all
      that I wasn’t. But the circle labeled “TGV negative” definitely had <i>not</i>
      turned blue. Now I was even more uncertain than I was before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      put the Insta-Read back in its wrapper and slipped it into my pocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris
      had already gotten all of the refugees onto their horses and made them put their
      blindfolds on. Everyone was already waiting for me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I pulled
      myself onto the saddle behind Chris. My heart was pounding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      we started moving up the trail, I reached around Chris and handed him the applicator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      don’t understand,” I said. “It’s broken, right?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris took the
      Insta-Read. He read it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a moment he said nothing. Then he
      shook his head and sighed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I was afraid of something like this,”
      he whispered. “I didn’t expect stage three, but I was afraid of this. Oh my
      God, Ashley. I’m so sorry.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What do you mean?” I whispered back.
      “Something’s wrong with it. Something has to be wrong with it. Even if I was
      infected, there’s no way I could be stage three. It’s broken. It has to be.
      Right?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“These don’t break,” Chris said. He was being so uncharacteristically
      patient with me, it was frightening. “It doesn’t work like that,” he explained.
      “These applicators test for a protein that’s unique to the TGV bacteria. It’s
      physically impossible for the blue lines to appear without the presence of that
      protein.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You’re wrong,” I insisted. I couldn’t believe how certain
      Chris seemed when I was so obviously <i>not</i> anywhere near the state of a
      stage-three positive. “Chris,” I said. “I never <i>died! </i>Don’t you think
      I’d fucking remember something like that? <i>Dying?</i> I never even got sick!
      How could I be stage three if I’m still <i>alive?</i>”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Are you
      sure about that?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Am I sure about not having died? Yes, I’m pretty
      fucking sure about that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Seriously, Ashley. Are you <i>sure</i>?”
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris turned around in the saddle to face me, then he put his
      hand on my forehead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What are you doing?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I was
      suspicious that something might be up when I disinfected your feet. You were
      <i>warm</i>, Ashley. Positives run a slightly high temperature. About a hundred
      and one degrees. I felt it in your feet. And, yes, I can feel your temperature
      now. It’s high.” He pulled his hand from my forehead and turned back around.
      “So are you <i>sure</i> you didn’t die?” he whispered. “Are you absolutely sure
      you never woke up filled with energy and in an unusual state of elevated confidence?
      Are you <i>sure</i> that never happened? I bet you’ve even been craving milk
      protein and high-caloric foods, haven’t you . . . ?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh my God.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d
      suddenly remembered the motel room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d woken up after a night
      of extremely heavy drinking, but feeling great. I remembered feeling like I
      could race up a cliff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Oh my God,” I said again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had
      I <i>died</i> that night? Was it possible? Had I been too drunk to notice?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That
      night,” I whispered. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What night?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It wasn’t the
      first time I’d slept with Bryce two days ago,” I confessed. “The first time
      I slept with him was the first night of the fair. The night everything happened.
      but I don’t remember anything. I have no idea if we even used a condom. And
      when I woke up late the next day, I felt, well . . . <i>really amazing</i>.”
      I let my head fall against Chris’s back. “Oh my God. Chris? Am I dead?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He
      turned around to look at me. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I think you must have . . . died,
      that night.” He shook his head in amazement. “That must have been when it happened.
      You must have contracted the pathogen from Bryce, then passed out from alcohol.
      You didn’t even know it happened. You must have fallen into a coma, died there
      in the motel bed, then woke up thinking you’d just had a heavy night of drinking.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“But
      how is that <i>possible</i>?” I was still totally confused. I didn’t want to
      believe any of this. “I’m not walking around like some kind of fucking zombie!”
      It was getting hard to keep my voice low enough that the refugees wouldn’t hear
      me. “I’m here! I’m me! If <i>anything</i>, I should be only stage one? Right?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That’s
      what I don’t understand,” Chris said. “If you drew three blue lines, your blood
      has to be more than half honey at this point. I <i>thought</i> something was
      up with you yesterday, the way you confronted that ranger kid and shot him like
      that. The pathogen is affecting your behavior, obviously. It’s turning on your
      genes for confidence, and even pleasure. I can tell. It’s doing everything it
      can to make you more sexually attractive and sexually active both. And, honestly,
      now I understand why I’ve been so fucking turned on by you ever since picking
      you up at the fairgrounds. It’s been killing me. Seriously. I haven’t even been
      able to think straight. And now I get it. Now I know why.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You
      didn’t assume it was just my natural sexual charm?” I couldn’t believe I was
      joking. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris let himself laugh. “Well yeah,” he said. “Your
      natural sexual charm, and the fact that your pores are oozing with pheromones.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even
      knowing I was <i>dead</i>, I felt strangely indifferent about it. Ever since
      robbing the pharmacy, I <i>was</i> feeling oddly invincible. It was true. The
      pathogen must have been giving me some weird natural high. But the disease seemed
      to be affecting me differently than other people. Maybe I was dead, but I wasn’t
      deteriorating. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So maybe I have little more confidence,” I said.
      “Fine. But how come I’m not like Morgan was, at the end? I don’t understand.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Honestly,”
      Chris said, “I don’t understand either. Maybe you have some kind of different
      pathogen strain. I’d love to give you a blood test, but it’s not like that’s
      going to fucking happen any time soon, way out here. So I have no idea why.
      But, Ashley, you’re definitely infected. I have no doubt about it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      thought about this. It was strange that I wasn’t more concerned. Truthfully,
      I was glad I wasn’t more concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Do you think this could last?”
      I whispered. “Is it possible I could just go on like this? Like maybe the disease
      is somehow <i>different</i> for me?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris sighed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I
      have no idea,” he said. “I sure hope so. But I have no way of knowing.”</p>\r\n\r\n<br><p><span
      class=\"new_section_first_letter\">W</span>e reached the ravine just before
      sunset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cliff dwellings were even more extensive than I’d
      remembered, and they looked beautiful as we approached them in the evening light.
      The low sun brought out the stone’s natural orange hue, and the rock walls glowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      told all of the refugees they could take off their blindfolds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It
      was a perfect place to hide away. The ravine was narrow, but formed on the north
      side by a large overhanging cliff. The dwellings, ancient buildings, most of
      them still intact, were formed by a series of sturdy sandstone walls. Some of
      the structures were three stories high, reaching all the way to the ceiling
      of the hanging cliff. Ever since exploring this place with my dad as a kid,
      I remembered walking through the complex’s interconnected passageways and looking
      out the stone windows. There must have been thirty or forty rooms in all, plenty
      of space for everyone. There was even a freshwater spring at the base of the
      ravine. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remembered that my dad told me the people who had built
      the dwellings, the Anasazi Native Americans, had been hiding out from an aggressively
      warlike rival group. We couldn’t have hoped for a better hiding place. Because
      of the cliff, the structures weren’t even visible from the air. And because
      my dad had kept the place a secret, it still hadn’t ever appeared on any maps.
      We were the only ones who knew about it. As long as word didn’t get out, the
      Home Guard would need to search for months, years even, before tracking us here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Well,
      here’s our Hole in the Wall,” Chris said, slipping off the saddle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
      refugees began exploring the dwellings. People were actually laughing with one
      another as they walked from room to room, sounding hopeful for once. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      took Kaypay and the rest of the horses to the spring and watered them in the
      last of the evening light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a round dugout at the center
      of the dwelling complex that must have been for storing food once, but we used
      it as a place to light a fire and heat up our ration packs. Chris made the rounds
      passing out another dose of antibiotics. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I didn’t take any.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d decided to wait and see how my condition progressed. I tried
      not to think too much about it, but I couldn’t help it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I excused
      myself early from the fire and took my blanket to the small stone room I’d claimed
      for myself. I needed to be alone for a little while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was terrified
      at what it meant to be infected, and what it meant to be dead. And yet I <i>felt</i>
      alive. I even felt a little good about how things were going. I’d managed, with
      Chris’s help, to get a group of refugees a supply of antibiotics and a safe
      place to stay, for now anyway. Of course, we still had a lot to do. More refugees
      would come, we had to figure out a way to get a steady supply of provisions,
      and winter was on its way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I’d accomplished something. And
      if the pathogen that was nesting in my brain was busy turning on genes that
      were giving me the confidence to help all of these people, then what did it
      matter if I was dead or alive? What was the difference which of my genes were
      turned off or on, if they all belonged to me anyway? Maybe the pathogen was
      part of me now too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stars gleamed outside the stone window.
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t help it. I started to think about Ian. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      couldn’t help but hope that I’d see him again, somehow, somewhere, however naïve
      and unrealistic it was that he’d ever forgive me. I’d been trying so hard not
      to think about him all this time, and now not thinking about him was just too
      much to bear. It was impossible not to wish that he was with me as I lay there
      alone in the darkness. It wasn’t right to wish for that. It wasn’t fair to my
      sister, or even to Ian. I know it wasn’t. But it’s what I felt, and I couldn’t
      change it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However the pathogen may have been affecting my thoughts,
      they were still <i>my</i> thoughts. All of my yearning and regrets and actions
      were still <i>me. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I may even have been dead, but <i>I</i>
      was still <i>me</i>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And whatever I was about to think, or feel,
      or do next in my life, I was okay with that. I had to be.</p>\r\n</div>"

    - Author's Update, Part 7
    - '2014-02-19 02:52:00.000000'
    - "<div class=\"blog_text\"><p>I can’t believe I finally finished the novel! This
      is my first book, so it feels like a huge accomplishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When
      I first started writing <i>Dead in Bed</i>, I never, ever thought that I’d be
      posting the last part from a motel on the way to California. But that’s what
      I’m doing. I finished the last scene of Part 7 in the back of Kyle’s car while
      he was driving. He’s been at the wheel for like ten hours straight, and he’s
      totally exhausted. Right now, it’s like three in the morning, we're in like
      Nevada or somewhere, and he’s asleep where he collapsed on the motel’s bed.
      It’s our first night on the road. (He’s actually snoring a little! It’s so cute!)
      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m <i>so</i> excited. I don’t even really feel afraid. Maybe
      I’ll start feeling afraid and regretting this later, but right now I’m <i>so</i>
      glad I made this choice. I feel <i>so</i> alive. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I called my
      dad and told him I’m safe, but I wouldn’t tell him where I am or that I’m with
      Kyle. I just told him I’m with a “friend” and that I’ll be back sometime in
      the summer. He didn’t even yell at me. I was stunned. He just kind of quietly
      repeated “Uh-huh” when I was telling him all this. He was kind of in shock.
      I've never heard him like that before. I think he couldn't bring himself to
      believe that I was actually telling the truth that I’d left. After a long silence
      he just said, very quietly, “Bailey, you come home. Right now.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      just hung up the phone. And that was it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can’t believe I actually
      did this. And I can’t wait to get to California! We’re going straight to LA
      first. I actually booked a sublet for us online. I had to empty out half my
      savings account to do it, but I wanted to surprise Kyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve
      been writing so hard that I’ve decided to give myself a little break and enjoy
      myself for just a little while. But I have some really exciting ideas for what’s
      going to happen to Ashley and Muldoon in the sequel. So stay tuned! The second
      book is on its way really soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">xxBailey</p>\r\n</div>"
