      <p>The blog you are about to read was hosted by a teen under the name “Bailey Simms” for more than a year. Little is still known about the author’s actual identity.</p>

      <p>Among Ms. Simms’s blog posts is a completed serialized novel which has now been published as <i>Dead in Bed</i>. Interspersed within the novel’s segments, blog updates describe events in the author’s life from the winter of 2013 until the spring of 2015. At that point, the posts abruptly stop.</p>

      <p>None of this blog’s original material has been altered. The contents are disturbing.</p>

      <p>Okay, here I go. My first blog post. Deep breath . . .</p>

      <p>So, hi everyone! Or, I guess I should say: hi absolutely no one! Because I’m sure exactly <i>zero</i> people are actually going to read this blog, and I’m pretty much just going to be shouting into the deep dark abyss of the internet. But whatever. I don’t care. If I don’t force myself to start a blog and post segments of my novel to it every week or so, I know I’ll never actually write it. And I really want to write this novel. Doing it means a lot to me. That’s why I’ve decided to publicly commit to it in this post.</p>

      <p>In case someone actually <i>does</i> end up following this, thank you SO MUCH for reading! Seriously. You’re awesome and I love you! Please ignore the fact that I don’t even know you. You’re reading my blog, so I love you anyway despite that major flaw in our relationship. If you have any questions, just comment! Best way to reach me. I’ll totally respond. </p>

      <p>Anyway, the very first installment of my novel is coming in the next update! It’s going to be called <i>Dead in Bed</i>. So stay tuned.</p>

      <p>xxBailey</p>

    - '<p><span class="first_letter">I</span> woke up in a motel room I''d never seen.
      No matter how hard I''ve thought about it since, I have no memory of how I got
      there or what happened the night before.</p><p>There were beer bottles all over
      the side table, not to mention a completely empty eighth of Jack Daniels. What
      looked like some kind of fancy foreign wine bottle, also drained, was filled
      with cigarette butts. The TV, one of those old boxy sets, had fallen back against
      the wall, and in the corner an arm chair was lying on its side. Feathers were
      everywhere; one of the pillows had been torn open.</p><p>I was pretty sure I
      was alone. No one was in bed with me. When I leaned over to check the floor
      I saw only more feathers and more beer bottles scattered across the carpet&mdash;along
      with my clothes. All of them. My jeans were in a pile against the wall with
      my underwear still bunched inside. My bra hung over the one arm chair that was
      still standing.</p><p>I was totally naked. And I''d definitely had sex. I was
      sore, and not just a little. I hadn''t felt like this since Shawn and I were
      in high school and going at it like rabbits senior year.</p><p>But we hadn''t
      had sex in months, as far as I could remember.</p><p>I tried not to think about
      the fact that there was no good reason I would have needed to check into a motel
      if it was my husband I''d had sex with.</p><p>And yet despite my fear about
      whatever it was I''d done that night, and despite my apparent blackout, and
      the pervasive smell of stale cigarettes&mdash;and some other smell too, I noticed
      now, something faintly rancid&mdash;I felt, well . . . <i>great</i>.</p><p>It
      was as if I''d been sleeping for days and had woken up completely refreshed.
      I didn''t have the slightest headache, not a hint of nausea. I practically bounced
      out of bed. When I pulled on my pants I felt like I had the energy to race up
      a mountain.</p><p>But I still couldn''t remember anything.</p><p>Other than
      the bottles everywhere, there was no evidence of whoever else had been with
      me in the room. The only clothes I''d found on the floor had been mine, and
      the bathroom was empty. All that was in the mini-bar fridge, weirdly, was an
      empty gallon milk container.<p><p>I looked under the bed and checked my pockets,
      but I couldn''t find my phone. So I couldn''t even look at my recent calls.
      Had I lost it, or had someone stolen it? I had no idea.</p><p>It was a beautiful
      day outside, but when I stepped into what I recognized now as the parking lot
      of the Starlight Motel, I realized that it wasn''t morning. The sun was already
      starting to set. Apparently I''d slept all afternoon.</p><p>Now that I was out
      in the fresh air, things started to come back to me about the day before, if
      not the night.</p> <p>Suddenly I remembered what Ian and I had found at the
      high school.</p><p>I remembered how I''d helped carry it. I remembered the stench,
      and how afterward I couldn''t quite wash off the smell. I wondered if maybe
      that''s what I''d been smelling inside the motel room.</p><p>I also remembered
      why my car was nowhere to be seen. I live in Muldoon, Colorado, and if you haven''t
      heard of it, you''re basically like everybody else in the world who isn''t from
      Muldoon. We don''t even have a stop light. It''s that small. The only thing
      that ever happens is the fair, once a year. The kids sell their livestock, there''s
      a carnival and a rodeo, and everyone pretty much has an excuse to get drunk
      all weekend.</p><p>I do the books at this trucking company whose office is right
      across from the fairgrounds. I usually park in the lot there, and when I got
      off work early yesterday there was this huge bus blocking my car. It was emblazoned
      with a massive <i>Bryce Tripp</i> logo. He''s supposed to be this up-and-coming
      country star, but, honestly, I hadn''t heard of him before a few days ago. (How
      big could he really be if he was giving a concert at the Muldoon fair?) The
      people in charge of his bus must have been waiting to get into the rodeo grounds
      where his concert was going to be, but I couldn''t find the driver anywhere.
      I couldn''t even reach my husband because the cell phones were already jammed
      from everyone arriving from out of town.</p><p>So I''d asked my boss for a ride
      home; I remembered now. I''d figured I''d worry about my car later. I hadn''t
      really needed it anyway then because Ian, my brother in law, was supposed to
      give me and Shawn a ride to the fair that night so we could drink, then he was
      going to bring us home later.</p><p>That had been the plan anyway.</p><p/>Now
      I was at the Starlight Motel, alone, without a car or phone, and still no memory
      at all of how I got there</p> <br><p><span class="new_section_first_letter">I</span>
      tried to go back and piece together everything that had happened the previous
      day as best as I could. </p><p>First, I remembered that when my boss dropped
      me at home, Shawn was already there, watching TV, as usual. His station at the
      couch was pretty much the only place he spent time lately when he wasn''t at
      work. He has a shift at the mill, which I know can be exhausting, but it''d
      been months since he''d been out. And lately he''d started saying he didn''t
      want me to go out with any of my friends alone. One of the reasons I''d been
      looking forward to the fair for weeks was that Shawn wouldn''t have any choice
      but to get off his ass and go somewhere. I''d been hoping that maybe we could
      have a little fun again, for once.</p><p>"I''m getting in the shower," I called
      out, competing with the blare of Sports Center. "Ian''s gonna be here in an
      hour, remember?"</p><p>After a moment, Shawn yelled back. </p><p>"Tonight? We''ll
      go tomorrow," he said. "No one really shows up until Saturday anyway."</p><p>I
      should have seen this coming. If my husband never wanted to go out at all anymore,
      why would he ever go out for two nights in a row without complaining about it?
      I''d thought things would be different during fair, but I guess I''d been wrong.</p><p>I
      tried not to sound too irritated. "Everyone always goes tonight." I leaned into
      the living room and found myself talking to the back of my husband''s head.
      He was only twenty-six, but his hair was just beginning to thin. "All your friends
      are going. And mine. Morgan''s already there waiting for me. And Ian''s coming
      all the way back in the middle of Tyler''s football game just to give us a ride.
      It would be weird if you didn''t go."</p><p>I stepped into the bathroom and
      turned on the shower before Shawn could respond. I hoped that by putting myself
      out of earshot he would give up and agree to just go without a fight. </p><p>While
      I undressed, I forced myself to look at the mirror. I''d definitely put on a
      little weight since high school, but not as much as Shawn had, especially after
      his accident. But I looked okay, I decided. Nothing like Morgan, who''d somehow
      stayed as skinny as she was at sixteen. But at least I looked okay. </p><p>While
      the water warmed up, without really meaning to, I started considering what my
      night out would be like if Shawn <i>did </i>just stay at home. I thought about
      having the chance to ride into town with Ian alone. I thought about doing shots
      with Morgan, just the two of us. Maybe it wouldn''t have been the worst thing
      after all if Shawn didn''t come. In the middle of washing my hair, I actually
      started seriously considered persuading him to stay home. </p><p>But by the
      time I got out of the shower I could hear him changing from his work clothes,
      and I decided not to say anything. I couldn''t. Not after I''d already talked
      him into going. I''d feel too guilty if I did something like that, anyway. Besides,
      it would probably be good for us to get drunk together. </p><p>Ian pulled up
      to the house just as I was finishing with my makeup. I wore this new low-cut
      top I''d bought just for the fair and my tightest pair of jeans. Maybe it wasn''t
      exactly what they were wearing in Denver these days, but not bad for the Muldoon
      fair. </p><p>I could tell my brother-in-law was in a hurry to get back before
      the end of the high school football game, but he was too polite to say so. As
      we came out of the house Ian kept his truck idling, sauntered over to Shawn,
      and slapped his shoulder.</p><p>"Hey, buddy, you all ready for tonight?"</p><p>"Yup,"
      Shawn said. As always, Shawn was a little quiet and intimidated by Ian. "Ready
      to go."</p><p>"Hiya, sis!" Ian gave me a quick hug, then just as quickly he
      let me go and hopped back into his pickup. </p><p>Ian was in a good mood. On
      the way over he told us that Tyler got a touchdown, and besides being happy
      that his son had played well, he was looking forward to being out at the fair
      tonight too. I could tell. </p><p>"You sure you''re okay not drinking?" I asked
      him. "I''m glad I''m not the one stuck driving." </p><p>I was glad Ian had offered
      to give us a ride, but the truth is I also liked how Ian got after a couple
      drinks. He''d been a medic in Iraq, and now he worked as an EMT at our tiny
      local hospital. When he got back from the war I used to worry he''d break down
      or something if he drank, but he never did. Mostly he just got less serious
      and his sense of humor would come out. I''d laugh at his wry jokes, and he always
      laughed along with me in this kind and warmly boyish way he had. He''s actually
      really attractive&mdash;way more attractive than Shawn&mdash;but sometimes I
      think my sister doesn''t even realize this.</p><p>"Who says I can''t have a
      beer?" Ian winked at me. "It''s fair time. I''ll nurse one for a little while."
      He nudged Shawn''s arm. "Just don''t tell Danielle."</p><p>I knew Ian really
      wouldn''t have any more than one drink. I don''t think I know anyone who''s
      more responsible. Besides, if he did, my sister would find out one way or another
      and kill him. </p><p>I was about to ask whether he was taking Haley, his youngest,
      to the carnival tonight, but that''s when Ian''s phone rang.</p><p>The gruff,
      semi-garbled voice on the speakerphone must have been a hospital dispatcher,
      but I couldn''t make out who it was. "Ian, you there at the school?" the voice
      asked. </p><p>"Just left," Ian said.</p><p>"I guess someone had a fall in the
      girl''s shower, or something. We just got a call from Bernice, but couldn''t
      quite make out what she was saying. The ambulance is still here at the hospital.
      We''re wrapping up Toby''s ankle now."</p><p>Ian switched off the speaker and
      brought the phone to his ear. "Yeah, I''ll be there in a couple minutes." </p><p>He
      hung up.</p><p>"That Toby Hollis kid sprained his ankle pretty bad in the first
      quarter," he told us. "Ambulance is still tied up wit him. You don''t mind if
      we make a little detour, do you? It''s probably nothing, but I gotta check it
      out."</p><p>"That''s alright," I said. </p><p>But in truth I was feeling selfish
      and a little disappointed that Ian couldn''t just drop us at the fairgrounds.
      What kind of town only had one ambulance? I guess Ian''s SUV was the sole backup.
      </p><p>Ian pulled right up to the door of the girl''s locker room. The second
      half of the football game had already started. I could hear the hum of the crowd
      over at the field, but the gym was deserted. Shawn stepped from the pickup,
      but in an old high-school habit he was hesitant about going into the girls''
      locker room, which I thought was kind of sadly funny, as if he were still just
      a kid. </p><p>Ian was in a hurry. "Come on in, if you want," he told us. "We''re
      a little understaffed." He laughed. "Maybe you could give me a hand, if I need
      it."</p><p>I hadn''t stepped into the locker room for years. Bernice Whipple,
      my old P.E. teacher, was even there. It was like she lived there. </p><p>"Hey,
      Mrs. Whipple." I gave her my best version of a friendly wave. But she didn''t
      even register my presence. </p><p>She was distraught, expressionless. She went
      right for Ian. She grabbed his jacket, then she led him toward the showers.</p><p>"Here,"
      she said, whispering. "Here. It''s here."</p><p>I followed behind, trying to
      stay out of the way.</p><p>When I first saw what was on the tile floor&mdash;the
      same place I''d stood showering a hundred times in high school&mdash;I thought
      maybe some kid was playing a joke, trying to scare the cheerleaders or something.
      </p><p>There were shards of broken glass all over the shower, and, right above,
      one of the big frosted windows had been broken out. </p><p>There wasn''t any
      blood. Just a person, naked, face down. It wasn''t a high-schooler at all, but
      a grown man, his bare ass in the air, his skin unnaturally pale from head to
      foot. </p><p>He was very obviously not alive. </p><p>I''d never seen a dead
      body before, not ever. But I was sure that no living person could lie that perfectly
      still. </p><p>This definitely wasn''t what Ian had expected when he''d invited
      us in. He rushed to the body and knelt beside it. In what seemed like one motion,
      he opened his medical bag and snapped on a blue latex glove. He pinched one
      of the body''s wrists, gently, checking for a pulse I guess, but he must not
      have got what he needed because he put on the other glove, grabbed one of the
      shoulders, and turned the whole body over.</p><p>It jostled onto its back and
      lay face up. </p><p>I didn''t think I recognized whoever it was, but the face
      was so sunken and gray I wasn''t sure. To me, it looked like someone that had
      been dead for a long time, weeks maybe. But I guess I don''t know anything about
      how bodies decay&mdash;the cheerleaders must have used the locker room only
      a couple of hours earlier, and the body couldn''t have been in the shower then.
      </p><p>Ian touched the body''s throat, again checking for a pulse which I knew
      wouldn''t be there. </p><p>I''d been so distracted by the deteriorated face,
      it was only now that I noticed what Ian was staring at. He and everyone else.
      </p><p>Mrs. Whipple was letting out this long-winded weeping sound and starting
      to cry. </p><p>Ian glanced at me, obviously regretting that he''d let me and
      Shawn come inside, but now there wasn''t anything he could do about it. He returned
      his attention to the body, maybe not entirely sure what to do next.</p><p>It
      was missing its penis. Where the penis should have been was just this short
      fleshy stump. The wound was raggedly scabbed over and looked infected. </p><p>I
      was so stunned that I didn''t even feel sick, not even when I saw what was below
      the missing penis: two baseball-sized spheres of tightly swollen flesh. They
      were the testicles, puffed up unnaturally and darkened to a deep, blackish purple,
      like a pair of giant toxic mushrooms. </p><p>I could hear Shawn breathing heavily
      behind me. I worried he was about to pass out and I wouldn''t know what to do.</p><p>"Holy
      fuck," he whispered. </p><p>In the middle of all of this, Ian''s phone rang.
      He fumbled to answer it. </p><p>He listened. "Yeah, it''s here," he said. I
      could tell it was the hospital dispatcher again. "<i>Now</i> you tell me," Ian
      said, exasperated, then he paused. "Right now?" Another pause. "That''s not
      how we do things. I don''t care who&mdash;" He stopped and listened again. After
      a minute, reluctantly he said, "Well, I guess. I guess if that''s what they
      say. I don''t know. I''ll do what I can. Jesus."</p><p>Ian stood and turned
      away from us. For a moment he just held his wrist to his head, apparently trying
      to figure out what to do. Outside, in the distance, the football game''s final
      buzzer sounded over the loudspeakers.</p><p>"Shit." </p><p>Finally Ian turned
      toward us. </p><p>"We have to get this out of here right now." He gave my husband
      a hard look. "Shawn, buddy. I hate to ask you to do this. But I need a hand.
      I can''t get it into my rig on my own. I got pretty strict orders to clear this
      out before the crowd comes through after the game." He nodded in the general
      direction of the football field. "And everyone''s on their way now."</p><p>Shawn
      was silent. He took one step backwards, then he threw up all over a changing
      bench. </p><p>Instinctively I put a hand on my husband''s back while he retched.
      I didn''t know what else to do. I glanced at Ian. He looked completely at a
      loss.</p><p>"I''ll help," I said. "I''ll do it."</p><p>I stepped toward the
      body before I could lose my nerve. Ian looked extremely uncomfortable, but I
      could tell he knew he didn''t have any other choice but to accept my help. </p><p>"Shit,
      Ashley," he began, "you don''t..." </p><p>"I can do it." I said. </p><p>I pulled
      two gloves from the cardboard box in Ian''s medical bag and put them on.</p><p>"Shit,"
      he said, again.</p><p>"Just tell me what to do. What do I do?"</p><p>Ian took
      a deep breath. "Alright. Shit. You take the ankles. It''s not far. Let''s just
      hurry and get this over with. God damn it, Ash. I owe you."</p><p>I tried not
      to think about what I was doing. I tried to tell myself that this was no different
      than a dead animal, or a dummy. </p><p>But as I clutched the body''s ankles,
      the tendons and bones beneath the skin felt so human and lifelike that I started
      to feel dizzy. I tried to breathe, but I hadn''t expected the smell to be so
      strong. It was definitely the smell of rotten flesh. I wondered if maybe the
      rancid smell was coming from the swollen testicles; they did look like they
      were rotting or maybe turning gangrenous.</p><p>I had to do something to distract
      myself so I wouldn''t throw up. I was desperate not to let Ian down. I knew
      that my sister wouldn''t be able to do this, and somewhere deep inside I''d
      always understood that Danielle couldn''t ever really let herself imagine what
      Ian must have gone through in the war. I wondered if by helping him now, in
      this unlikely way, maybe I could somehow acknowledge what my sister couldn''t.</p><p>"What
      do you think happened to him?" I asked Ian. </p><p>I didn''t actually care what
      had happened, not at that moment. But I couldn''t think of any other way to
      get my mind off the smell and the body''s sagging, loose weight in my hands
      as we shuffled through the locker room.</p><p>"I have no idea," Ian whispered.
      "He must have been trying to peep through the window. And then I guess he fell
      through the glass."</p><p>"But what about...?" I started. "Why is it missing?"
      </p><p>If I could barely bring myself to ask about the missing penis, I couldn''t
      even begin to mention the bloated testicles. They appeared at the point of bursting
      as the body swayed between us.</p><p>Ian gave me a look of total perplexity
      and shook his head. "I have <i>no</i> fucking idea."</p><p>"It''s one of those
      carnies!" Mrs. Whipple was still crying, but she was in control enough to make
      this last proclamation as she held the locker room door open for us, shuddering.
      "They''re all on drugs!" </p><p>The hardest part was lifting the body into the
      back of Ian''s SUV. </p><p>Ian laid the shoulders on the tailgate while I kept
      ahold of the ankles. I''d managed to control my nausea, but now my arms were
      burning. I didn''t even want to think about letting the body drop, or the sound
      of it hitting the pavement. Ian climbed into the back and pulled the shoulders
      from the inside, and finally I could let go. I looked around the dark lot outside
      the gym. I didn''t think anyone saw us, but I could hear the crowd from the
      game moving in our direction.</p><p>"You okay?" Ian asked.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>"I''m
      real sorry, Ash," he whispered. "Really."</p><p>"It''s okay." I tried to smile.
      "I fucking need a drink," I laughed, "but I''m okay."</p><p>Now Ian laughed
      too, obviously relieved that I''d been able to handle it. Maybe he was even
      a little impressed. </p><p>After laughing, though, he added earnestly, "Technically
      you weren''t supposed to see any of this. Right?"</p><p>"Right," I nodded. "Of
      course. Okay."</p><br><p><span class="new_section_first_letter">I</span> helped
      Shawn wash the splattered vomit off his shoes while Mrs. Whipple hurried to
      sweep up the broken glass. </p><p>I bought Shawn a Sprite from the vending machine,
      which he said helped his stomach, but I had to hurry him out of the locker room
      before the cheerleaders arrived. </p><p>By now everyone who had been watching
      the football game was passing through the parking lot on their way to the fair.
      No one seemed to have a clue about what had just happened. My sister was there
      with Haley, waiting for Tyler to finish showering. </p><p>"They won! Tyler scored!"
      Danielle waved to us. She had no idea what had just happened. "What are you
      guys doing here? I thought Ian was taking you straight to the beer garden."</p><p>"He
      got called to the hospital on the way, so he dropped us here." </p><p>Technically
      I wasn''t lying. I wasn''t sure what Ian did or didn''t want me to say, even
      to my sister.</p><p>Haley skipped over to me, obviously totally hopped up on
      excitement for the fair. I remembered feeling the same way when I was a kid.</p><p>"Aunt
      Ashley!" She slammed into me and gave me a hug. I hugged her back tentatively.
      I''d washed my hands and arms three times in the locker room, but I was still
      hesitant to touch my niece after what I''d just done. "Are you going with me
      to the carnival tonight?" she pleaded.</p><p>"Tomorrow!" I said. </p><p>It was
      so hard to say no to Haley. Over the last couple of years my niece had turned
      into this blonde-haired, wide-eyed kid, kind of small for her age, just like
      I''d been at nine. I got to play the role of the fun, slightly reckless aunt
      when I was with her. Last year at the fair we''d spent hours playing the same
      pin-ball horse racing carnival game I used to be addicted to as a kid, and I''d
      taught her how to cheat by tipping the machine. </p><p>But there was no way
      I was going to do anything tonight other than have a drink as soon as possible&mdash;an
      even stiffer one than I''d planned on earlier.</p><p>"But I want to play the
      horses!" Ashley whined.</p><p>Danielle cut in, saving me. "Aunt Ashley and Uncle
      Shawn are having an adults'' night tonight," she announced. "Grandma and Grandpa
      will take you to the horses."</p><p>Haley looked up at me, pouting, which was
      annoying but still I felt guilty for letting her down.</p><p>"Tomorrow we''ll
      play the horses," I promised. "Just you and me."</p><p>"You guys want a ride
      over?" Danielle asked. "Tyler''s still gonna be a while."</p><p>"I feel like
      a walk," I said. "Maybe I''ll see you over there."</p><p>It felt weird just
      traipsing off to the fair after everything that had happened. Someone had just
      died, and I''d just helped carry his body in my hands. It all felt completely
      unreal. I guess the right thing to do would have been to just go home, have
      a sober, contemplative evening, and try to make sense of what had happened.
      But I couldn''t imagine anything worse than being stuck alone with Shawn way
      out there in our quiet little house. I needed to be around people, a lot of
      them. I needed to get rid of the image of the mutilated body. I could still
      feel its weight in my arms. I was also really hoping to catch up with Ian later
      and find out if he''d learned anything about who the guy was, or what had happened
      to him before falling into the locker room, or why we''d had to rush the body
      away so fast.</p><p>Shawn and I joined the crowd making its way to the fairgrounds.
      I kept expecting him to object to continuing on to the fair, but he just walked
      along beside me silently, still pretty pale in the face. </p><p>"How are you?"
      I asked, folding my arms against the September evening air.</p><p>"Fine," he
      said. "I''m fine."</p><p>He didn''t really look at me. </p><p>I knew he was
      embarrassed that I''d had to be the one to help Ian. This is why he wasn''t
      saying anything. He would have been too ashamed to insist on running home now
      if I wasn''t suggesting it first. Or maybe he also just really wanted a drink.</p><br><p><span
      class="new_section_first_letter">W</span>hen we reached the beer garden, Morgan
      wasn''t even there yet. She was always late. I should have known. </p><p>I texted
      her, and she replied right back. </p><p>"<i>b ther soon wait 4 me.</i>"</p><p>So
      there was nothing to do now but wait around with Shawn''s friends, who of course
      had been at the beer garden for at least an hour by then.</p><p>Jason Gibbs
      was already mostly drunk. Right away he bought me and Shawn a beer. </p><p>Jason
      was a few years younger than us. I even used to babysit him. In high school,
      he was the basketball star, but of course no one from Muldoon ever gets a scholarship
      anywhere so he''d worked at the mill for a while with Shawn. Now he was a highway
      patrol cop; I had no idea how he''d gotten the night off. He was always a little
      shit as a kid. He used to try to take Polaroids of me peeing from outside their
      bathroom window. For a while, though, I''d hoped that maybe he''d influence
      Shawn to go to the patrol academy too, and I guess I still did, so mostly I
      tolerated him as one of my husband''s friends.</p><p>Shawn drank his beer down
      as fast as I''d ever seen him drink. I bought the next round, getting a vodka
      tonic for myself this time.</p><p>"Whoa, Ashley!" Jason pressed his plastic
      beer cup into my drink. "Somebody''s partying tonight!"</p><p>"It''s been a
      long day," I confessed.</p><p>Jason tapped Shawn''s arm. "You better watch your
      wife, bro. It''s fair time. She keeps going like that, might end up with somebody
      else''s dick in her ass. Not saying whose, I''m just saying."</p><p>Shawn finished
      the last of his second beer. "You might end up with somebody''s dick down your
      throat, dude," he said. Some of his color had come back. "And I''m saying whose.
      Mine."</p><p>"Charming, as ever," I said to both of them. But I didn''t mind
      that Shawn had actually sort of stuck up for me, even if it was by threatening
      his friend with forced fellatio in the middle of ordering more beer.</p><p>I
      tried to express as much of my annoyance with Jason as possible, but I was distracted
      by the way his long, horsey face was capped by whatever spiked thing he was
      trying to do with his hair. A couple of strands actually kept bobbing up a down
      whenever he laughed, which I don''t think he was aware of.</p><p>"I don''t know,
      bro," Jason said, now without taking his eyes off me. "We have a history, me
      and Ashley. She told you didn''t she? She used to beg my parents to go out of
      town. I had the biggest cock of all the kids she babysat for. When they got
      home, she used to be, like, ‘No Mr. And Mrs. Gibbs, you don''t owe me anything.
      Little Jason took care of all my needs.'' Your wife''s a nympho, bro! Seriously!"</p><p>Apparently
      my husband thought the high-pitched voice Jason used to impersonate me was the
      funniest thing in the world. Shawn was laughing, and now Jason started laughing
      at his own joke, and this only made Shawn laugh harder. Apparently this was
      how much easier it was for Shawn to put the locker room out of his mind than
      it was for me.</p><p>"No, dude!" Shawn said. "You don''t even know! I mean,
      she kind of <i>is</i> a nympho!" My husband laughed hilariously at this revelation.</p><p>All
      I''d wanted was to have a drink and to try to calm down a little. And now I
      had to deal with this. </p><p>The worst part was that I didn''t even know what
      to say. I thought about bringing up how I knew Jason used to whack off to Tina
      Frame''s picture in the yearbook, but I didn''t have it in me. I was too mentally
      fried, and I didn''t care. I just sat there shaking my head like some prudish
      idiot.</p><p>"Ashleeeey!" Morgan''s arms suddenly wrapped around me from behind.
      She almost knocked me off my barstool.</p><p>I stood and hugged her back, spilling
      my drink. "Where the hell have you been?"</p><p>Morgan was already completely
      tanked. She gave me a big, whiskey-tainted kiss on the cheek. It was weird how
      happy I was to see her. For a moment I almost started to cry. </p><p>"<i>You</i>
      and <i>me</i>," Morgan said, shaking her hips with each word in a little drunken
      dance, "are going <i>to</i> ..."&mdash;she held up the back of her wrist, stamped
      with a green <i>T</i>&mdash;"the Bryce Tripp concert!"</p><p>Jason scoffed.
      "Bryce Drip''s a fucking faggot."</p><p>"And we''re leaving these two <i>losers"</i>&mdash;Morgan
      traced a circle in the air, then pointed at Jason''s and Shawn''s faces&mdash;"right
      here in the fucking <i>lame ass</i> beer garden." </p><p>Morgan displayed her
      stamped wrist again, then tilted her head coyly, held out her tongue, and, like
      an inebriated pole dancer, gave her stamped wrist a long, sexy lick. </p><p>Jason
      glanced at Shawn. </p><p>Now Morgan grabbed my wrist and pressed it against
      hers, transferring the green <i>T</i> concert stamp to my wrist, just like we
      used to do years ago to sneak one of us into the movie theater.</p><p>Before
      I could finish the last of my drink, Morgan was pulling me away by the hand.
      I didn''t even so much as wave to Shawn before leaving him there.</p><p>On the
      way through the carnival, Morgan hung on my shoulder and whispered, "I''ve been
      sleeping with Jason." She made a gagging sound. "Gross, huh! I know, I know!"</p><p>I
      was surprised. "Morgan!" She had this great body, but I''d always been the one
      with the more-or-less cute face. She was always trying to prove that she was
      attractive by sleeping with one guy or another. But I hadn''t expected she''d
      sleep with Jason. "Why him?"</p><p>"It''s okay, Ash," she said. "Because I''m
      already cheating on him!" Morgan snorted a laugh. "Don''t tell him! It''s way
      more fun cheating on him than it is sleeping with him!"</p><p>I couldn''t help
      but laugh with her. </p><p>"You''re fucking crazy," I said. I was actually feeling
      a little better. </p><p>As we passed the Tilt-A-Whirl I whispered, "So who are
      you cheating on him with, then?"</p><p>She held a finger to her lips. "Shhhhh.
      Not saying."</p><p>"Who? Tell me."</p><p>"Not saying!"</p><p>Morgan bounded
      ahead. I had no idea who her mystery man was, but I worried it might be someone
      married if she wouldn''t tell me. Knowing Morgan, though, I''d find out one
      way or another before too long. She never kept a secret.</p><p>She was already
      through the concert gates, waving at me to follow her in. </p><p>Suddenly I
      flashed on the body in the locker room, again. I''d actually managed to forget
      about it for a little while, but now the image of its mouth hanging open came
      back to me. I''d kept glimpsing its teeth while I''d helped Ian carry it. </p><p>For
      some reason this made me nervous about sneaking into the concert. We weren''t
      kids any more, and I''d be mortified if I got caught now, as an adult, especially
      tonight. I even knew the woman collecting tickets and checking stamps. Her husband
      was one of the truckers at the company I worked for. </p><p>Morgan gave me a
      shrug from the other side of the gate. Then she impatiently waved me in again.
      </p><p>"Hurry up!" she yelled.</p><p>I stepped forward, trying to keep as far
      from the counter as possible, holding up my wrist with its faint green <i>T</i>.
      I''d never been as good as Morgan was at playing things cool. </p><p>Of course
      the woman collecting tickets recognized me. </p><p>"Ashley! Hi! I thought you
      weren''t going to the concert?"</p><p>"Hey Helen," I smiled, scared; she already
      suspected me, I could tell. "Well, my friend bought me a ticket," I said awkwardly.
      "We came in earlier? I just went out for a sec to say hi to my niece."</p><p>I
      had no idea where these lies were coming from, or how believable they were.</p><p>"Well
      let''s see that stamp of yours."</p><p>My heart was pounding. This was so stupid.
      Someone had just died and I was about to get caught sneaking into a concert
      by some musician I''d never even heard of and whose bus had blocked my car in.
      </p><p>"I''m gonna be late!" I joked nervously.</p><p>Helen took my hand and
      examined the stamp. This was it. I glanced around. What would she do? Were there
      security guards she would call? I saw one guy, arms folded, standing at the
      entrance to the grandstands. I was pretty sure he was already looking over at
      me.</p><p>"That''s what I thought!" Helen declared, inspecting my stamp. "Ashley!"
      She frowned and clucked her tongue. "You''ve almost worn your stamp off already!
      I can barely see it. Here." She plunked her rubber stamp into the inkpad and
      gave me a fresh <i>T. </i>"Enjoy!"</p><p>As soon as I was through the gate,
      Morgan grabbed my arm and hurried me toward to the grandstands. </p><p>"You
      totally thought fucking Helen Sandburg was going to arrest you or something,
      didn''t you!" She laughed at me. "I saw the look on your face! You did! Always
      such a <i>good kid</i>." She squeezed my neck. "Ah, that''s why I love you."</p><p>I
      hated that Morgan thought about me that way. But it was true. I let that ass-hole
      Jason treat me like shit. I let Shawn belittle me after I''d just wiped vomit
      off his shoes. And now I was afraid that sweet wouldn''t-accuse-a-fly-of-buzzing
      Helen would turn me into the cops. It was a good thing Morgan loved me, however
      innocent she thought I was.</p><p>I was suddenly determined to get completely
      wasted.</p><p>The concert was packed. It was disorienting to see the rodeo grounds
      transformed into a country music venue and filled with so many people from out
      of town. I led Morgan all the way to the standing-only area in front of the
      stage. We must have missed all the opening acts because Bryce Tripp himself
      was already playing. He was sitting on a stool wearing boots and a sleeveless
      shirt, looking like an underwear model with a guitar and a cowboy hat. I thought
      maybe he was even wearing makeup. </p><p>He was singing some ballad that nobody
      seemed to know except for a small group of middle-aged women I didn''t recognize,
      each holding up a cigarette lighter and swaying idiotically. </p><p>Pretty much
      everybody else was at least as drunk as they were, but more restless. A couple
      of guys I recognized from Biggs, the next town over, started yelling at the
      stage.</p><p>"Hey dick lick! Pick it up, pretty boy! Fucking slow!"</p><p>Bryce
      Tripp seemed to get the hint. Next song he called out his backup band, slung
      on an electric guitar, and started playing a much faster song whose only lyrics
      I could catch were "beer" and "bullets." </p><p>Half the crowd was down in front
      of the stage dancing drunkenly. Morgan bought beers and managed to pour a shot''s-worth
      each of whiskey from her purse flask. "Boilermakers!" She yelled over the speakers.
      </p><p>I could tell already that the concert wasn''t going to end well. There
      was just this feeling in the air. Too many guys who basically wanted to drink,
      and drink more, and then break whatever rule they could find to break. Halfway
      into his set, Bryce Tripp slowed it down again, this time playing a crooning
      love song. A guy nearby took the opportunity to slow-dance with this girl I
      vaguely recognized from the beer garden. He had his hands all over her, then
      he started really grabbing her ass. I was pretty sure she''d been with somebody
      else at the beer garden. It was actually kind of weird how the guy wasn''t just
      grabbing her ass but totally reaching around and down between her legs, and
      she was just letting him go at it.</p><p>That''s when I got knocked over. </p><p>Some
      guy had trampled into me, fists swinging. As I fell, his elbow caught me behind
      the ear. I spilled what was left of my second boilermaker and scraped my palm.
      </p><p>"Ass hole!" Morgan screamed and tried to help me up.</p><p>This was just
      as the guy who''d knocked me down&mdash;it was the same guy I''d seen with the
      girl in the beer garden&mdash;punched the guy she was dancing with squarely
      in the face. But then yet another guy I''d never seen before pushed them both
      right back into us, and we got knocked over again. </p><p>An all-out brawl broke
      lose. </p><p>Morgan and I crawled to the edge of the stage, and Bryce Tripp
      finally stopped playing. A security guard took over the microphone while a handful
      of rent-a-cops tried to stop the melee. I checked my palm, which was only barely
      bleeding, and my head, which felt fine, but this may have had a lot to do with
      how drunk I was at that point.</p><p>When I looked up, Morgan was talking to
      Bryce Tripp. I couldn''t believe it.</p><p>"Why''d you stop playing?" she yelled
      out while the scuffle continued on, barely abated, behind her.</p><p>I was sure
      Bryce Tripp would just ignore her, but he actually smiled and said something.
      Neither of us could make it out over the bullhorn. </p><p>"What?" Morgan screamed.
      I hadn''t seen her this drunk in a long time.</p><p>Bryce Tripp smiled again
      and shook his head. I couldn''t believe it, but he actually approached us at
      the foot of the stage and kneeled down to talk to us.</p><p>"They won''t let
      me keep playing," he said. "It''s actually in my contract." </p><p>He had these
      crazy icy-blue eyes. I honestly don''t think I''d ever seen anyone better looking
      from this close, in person. </p><p>"You know," he added, and shrugged. "The
      ‘safety of the performer at risk'' and all that."</p><p>Morgan was in full flirting
      mode. "So you always do what <i>they</i> tell you to do?" </p><p>She has this
      weird ability to flirt without making a total ass of herself, no matter how
      drunk she is.</p><p>Bryce Tripp laughed. He was even cuter with a full grin.
      I actually felt this wave of attraction pass over me when he spoke. </p><p>"Yeah,"
      he nodded. "I usually do pretty much what they tell me."</p><p>Morgan put on
      a pout and pretended like she''d lost interest. "Well, that''s a shame."</p><p>"No,
      not really," Bryce Tripp shot back, still grinning. "I get paid all the same.
      This is my third brawl in two months. Just means I get the night off. Which
      is fine by me."</p><p>He stood, reached into his pocket, and pulled out a stack
      of what looked like business cards. </p><p>"Couple of backstage passes," he
      said, handing one to Morgan and one to me. "Looks like I''m free for the evening.
      Why don''t you come on over and say hello."</p><p>Then he just gave us this
      friendly wave and left.</p><p>As soon as he''d left the stage, Morgan clutched
      her pass and screamed.</p><p>"Oh my fucking God! How do we get back there?"</p><p>There
      was a little security gate beside the stage which seemed to be the only way
      in.</p><p>By then the brawl had shifted toward the grandstands and we were able
      to make our move. We had to avoid an inebriated trucker pinned to the ground
      by a couple of security cops, but we managed to race to the side of the stage
      without getting knocked over again. </p><p>I couldn''t stop laughing. I hadn''t
      forgotten the body, but I was so drunk by now, I actually didn''t care that
      someone had just died.</p><p>This little panicking security guard was the only
      person manning the backstage gate. He was so focused on the brawl, standing
      on his toes and yelling into his cell phone, that he just waved us in without
      even really looking at our passes. He was probably used to letting local girls
      with passes backstage.</p><p>The area behind the stage was strangely empty.
      There were these couches set up outside, and a cold-cut buffet, and coolers
      of what I assumed to be beer, but no one was around. Bryce Tripp''s trailer&mdash;the
      same one that had blocked my car&mdash;was now pulled up alongside this sitting
      area. </p><p>But Bryce Tripp himself was nowhere to be seen. I don''t know what
      I expected, but not this. </p><p>Morgan grabbed a beer from a cooler and sat
      on the couch. </p><p>Just then someone came out of the trailer. A guy. He was
      dressed in tapered jeans and a fitted shirt and looked ready for an L.A. nightclub.
      </p><p>He lowered his sunglasses, and it was only now that I realized fully
      that this was Bryce Tripp, the same guy who''d just been singing twangy country
      songs in a Stetson.</p><p>"How do you like my disguise?" he asked.</p><p>"I
      can''t say it''s an improvement," Morgan said.</p><p>He folded his glasses and
      stashed them in his vest pocket. </p><p>"So where we going?" he asked. "If I''m
      going to buy you drinks, you two have to lead the way. I''ve never been here
      before. Where are we, anyway? Muldoon? Is that what it''s called?"</p><p>"Muldoon,"
      I confirmed, stupidly.</p><p>Morgan laughed. "Which means there''s only one
      place to go! Come on."</p><br><p><span class="new_section_first_letter">T</span>he
      Buckshot Bar is the single establishment where you can buy beer on tap year-round
      in Muldoon. During fair time it never closes, and it''s basically standing-room-only,
      twenty-four hours a day, all weekend.</p><p>I don''t think anyone recognized
      Bryce Tripp when we came in. He turned the head of just about every girl he
      passed when we all made our way inside, and at least a dozen half-sozzled guys
      sized him up. But he looked so different out of his western clothes that no
      one realized he was the same guy on all the concert posters. Everyone figured
      he was just someone''s out-of-towner friend, some pretty boy from the city.</p><p>"Well,
      ladies," he said, wedging himself into a place at the bar between me and Morgan
      on one said and Tuck Schroep, my second-grade teacher''s husband, on the other.
      "What''ll it be?" </p><p>I was already barely able to keep my balance, but I
      let him order me a whiskey. </p><p>It was while I was doing the shot that I
      saw Shawn at the back of the bar. He was nodding drunkenly at one of his friends
      from the mill.</p><p>For just a moment I worried he''d see me shoulder-to-shoulder
      with this extremely attractive stranger, the only guy in the bar in skinny jeans,
      and get upset. </p><p>But in exactly the next moment, I <i>hoped</i> he''d see
      me. I thought again about his complete inability to help Ian with the body in
      the locker room, and the way he''d laughed at me with Jason. Fuck him. </p><p>"Nate!"
      I yelled at the bar tender, pounding my hand and drawing as much attention to
      myself as possible. "Three more Maker''s!"</p><p>I had no idea if this worked
      because I lost sight of Shawn while a surge of a dozen people spilled in from
      the cancelled concert. I''m sure the bar was well past its legal capacity. I
      could hardly breathe. </p><p>By the time our next round arrived, Tuck Schroep
      was talking at Bryce and Morgan from beneath his hairy white mustache. </p><p>"Clean
      off!" he was saying, making a chopping motion with his hand. "That''s right.
      I''m telling you. Somebody''d cut his thingy clean off!"</p><p>I realized he
      was talking about the body. </p><p>I knew the news of a mutilated corpse in
      the girls'' locker room was going to spread like prairie fire, but not this
      fast. Mrs. Whipple must have told anyone within earshot after the football game.
      </p><p>And now everyone was on edge. I could tell. People weren''t just drinking
      because it was fair time. People were nervous, afraid. Things like this didn''t
      ever happen in Muldoon. I''d never even seen Tuck Schroep drunk before, not
      ever, come to think of it.</p><p>"What''s he talking about!" Bryce laughed.
      He couldn''t seem to figure out if Tuck was crazy or not.</p><p>"I don''t know,"
      I lied. I was desperate to come up with a way to change the subject. Before
      I could think of how, though, Tuck broke in again.</p><p>"He was trying to rape
      one of the girls, I guess!" he declared. "One of the cheerleaders. I don''t
      know which one of them cut it off, but one of ‘em did. Well, good for them,
      I say."</p><p>Someone put a hand on my shoulder. At first I thought it was someone
      trying to pay Nate, but whoever it was kept his hand there and pulled a little,
      gently turning me around.</p><p>"How you holding up?"</p><p>It was Ian. </p><p>I
      practically knocked Morgan over hugging him. "You''re already here! I didn''t
      think I''d see you."</p><p>He looked at me a little warily. He''d changed clothes;
      he''d probably showered. He was wearing his Army hoodie. He glanced at Bryce,
      then back at me. </p><p>"How you holding up?" he asked again.</p><p>"Fine!"
      I yelled over the bar''s noise. "Fine! Totally fine. Drunk off my ass, but fine!"</p><p>Bryce
      Tripp held out his hand. "Hey I''m Bryce," he said, charmingly.</p><p>Ian shook
      his hand. He was polite, but wary. "Ian." </p><p>I was actually pretty drunk
      at that point, but I could see right away that Ian was the only person in the
      bar who recognized Bryce Tripp from the posters. </p><p>"Buy you a drink?" Bryce
      asked him.</p><p>"Nate!" Morgan yelled before Ian could respond. "Four more!"</p><p>Ian
      grinned at me for the first time since he''d said hello. </p><p>"I did say I
      might have just one."</p><p>Bryce raised his shot glass. "Well, then, to&mdash;where
      are we? Muldoon! Prettiest little place I''ve ever avoided getting my ass kicked.
      So far." </p><p>Morgan laughed, we all clinked Bryce''s glass with ours, and
      I drank down yet another whiskey&mdash;who knows how many by that point. </p><p>After
      that point, things start to get hazy.</p><p>I remember Morgan talking to Ian
      about bear hunting with her dad, and Ian just nodding and listening to her drunken
      blather because he was too nice to tell her just to shut the fuck up. I remember
      actually grabbing Bryce Tripp''s arm and peeling him away from Tuck Schroep&mdash;something
      I never would have done if I hadn''t been so totally wasted&mdash;and staggering
      with him in tow onto the insanely crowded dance floor. I think I remember Shawn
      watching us dancing, but I can''t say for certain.</p><p>Next, I remember&mdash;just
      barely&mdash;asking Bryce if he smoked, and then I remember him buying cigarettes
      from the vending machine. I think I remember having one more shot at the bar
      and going outside to smoke, and I''m pretty sure I remember that Morgan actually
      talked Ian into having another shot with us. There was another moment outside&mdash;this
      one very hazy&mdash;when Bryce bummed someone''s last match, and he laughed
      when I told him he''d have to monkeyfuck me, which meant, I explained, lighting
      my cigarette from his. But I can barely remember this at all, and I can''t really
      say if it was before or after that round of shots with Morgan and Ian.</p><p>And
      that''s it, really. </p><p>The rest is totally gone. Anything else that happened
      that night is completely blacked out from my memory. </p><p>The next thing I
      remember is waking up alone in the Starlight Motel, sore from having had sex,
      without a phone, or a car, and, now, with night coming on.</p><p>I had no choice
      but to walk the half-mile from the motel to the fairgrounds, where I hoped my
      car would still be parked.</p><p>All the way there I still felt weirdly great.
      </p><p>I kept expecting a massive hangover to hit me, but it never came. I didn''t
      even have to pee, and I wasn''t really thirsty at all. I honestly don''t think
      I''d ever felt more rejuvenated in my life.</p><p>It was only when I reached
      the highway that I realized something was wrong. </p><p>It had to be the Saturday
      evening of fair weekend, but there wasn''t a single car on the road. </p><p>The
      traffic should have been bumper to bumper, even worse than it had been last
      night. Any other time of year, an empty highway would have been perfectly normal.
      But not tonight.</p><p>I walked faster. My footsteps through the gravel at the
      road''s shoulder was the only sound I could hear. It occurred to me, hurrying
      along while the sun sank into the mountains way off in the west, that I hadn''t
      seen a single person since I''d woken up. Not one.</p><p>The lights at the rodeo
      arena were on. And most of the street lights too. </p><p>But as I approached
      the fairgrounds, all of the carnival rides were totally dark. The Ferris wheel''s
      motionless silhouette rose up over the feedlot''s corrugated tin roof. There
      was no blaring carnival music, no roar of souped-up engines at the Saturday-night
      destruction derby, no cheers from the grandstands. </p><p>I hopped the fence
      into the parking lot. </p><p>There were only a few cars left. I was so relieved
      when I spotted my little gray sedan, parked all alone in the dimming evening
      light, that I practically ran to it. </p><p>I''d lost my set of keys along with
      my phone, but thank God Shawn had insisted that I keep a spare hidden under
      the battery. I popped the hood and found the extra key right where it should
      have been. </p><p>But the car door wasn''t locked. Which was odd, because if
      there was ever I time I''d be sure to lock my car door, it was during fair,
      especially if I''d parked in the public lot. </p><p>I wanted to get out of there
      as soon as I could and go home, or maybe to my parents'', or to Ian and Danielle''s,
      and to figure out what the fuck was going on. </p><p>I tried not to think about
      the unlocked door for now and I jammed the key into the ignition. Just as I
      put the car into drive I noticed something on the passenger seat.</p><p>It was
      a hoodie. A man''s. I kept my foot on the brake and held up the fabric. </p><p>It
      was Ian''s black Army hoodie. The one I''d seen him wearing at the bar. </p><p>So
      Ian had been in my car last night. </p><p>I tried again to think as hard as
      I could about what had happened after we were all at the bar. But it was no
      use. I had no memory whatsoever of anything after that.</p><p>In the dimming
      light I almost didn''t even see that there was something else on the seat. But
      when I moved the hoodie aside, there it was. </p><p>A gun. Ian''s gun. I recognized
      it right away. </p><p>It wasn''t like Ian was one of those guys who packed everywhere
      he went, but he must have been carrying it last night in the bar. And he must
      have had a reason. </p><p>But why would he have left his gun in my car? With
      the door unlocked? </p><p>I didn''t make sense. </p><p>Something was wrong.
      Something was really wrong. I had to get to Ian right away. I had to talk to
      him and find out what the hell was going on. </p><p>I hit the gas and drove
      my little car as fast as I could to toward the fairground''s nearest exit.</p><p>The
      exit was in the back, near the stockyard. On the way there I saw that everything
      at the carnival was totally shut down. All the food stalls were closed, and
      as far as I could tell, even the animals had been taken out of their pens. My
      headlights flooded the road and all of the motionless rides, but I didn''t see
      a single soul.</p><p>When I reached the gate, it was blocked. </p><p>A pair
      of wooden police barriers spanned the entire road. What the fuck was going on?</p><p>I
      almost screamed when someone knocked hard on my window.</p><p>"Ma''am?" It was
      a male voice, but it was too dark now to see who it was. Another couple of pounding
      knocks. "Can''t leave here, Ma''am."</p><p>It was a cop. He was knocking with
      his flashlight. I don''t know if I was more relieved that it was a cop and not
      someone trying to kill me or that it was simply another human being, the very
      first I''d seen that day. </p><p>I rolled down the window.</p><p>My eyes adjusted
      to the glare of the flashlight, and now I could see that the cop was Jason.
      Fucking great.</p><p>"I''m not authorized to let you through here, Ma''am."</p><p>"<i>Ma''am</i>?
      Who''s <i>Ma''am</i>? What the fuck, Jason?"</p><p>"Ashley. Whatever. You can''t
      pass through here." He was obviously still hung over, but this wasn''t stopping
      him from acting like an ass-hole cop now that he was on duty. "Vehicles can''t
      come or go until the search is over. Why are you even here? Why aren''t you
      at home?"</p><p>"I''m trying to <i>go</i> home," I said. "Just let me out."
      </p><p>"Can''t. Can''t let anyone in or out. We still haven''t caught those
      guys yet."</p><p>"What guys?"</p><p>"Are you kidding me?" Jason leaned casually
      against my car and folded his arms. This enraged me even further. "The guys
      who attacked that girl. Where have you been?"</p><p>Immediately my thoughts
      leapt to Haley. "What girl?" </p><p>"I don''t know." Jason shrugged. "Some girl.
      Some kid. It was two guys who did it. We''re still looking for them. We''re
      combing the fairgrounds. It''ll take a little time. The whole place is locked
      down. Here and the high school both. How do you not know about all this? Everyone
      was supposed to be out by two-thirty last night. They were announcing it for
      hours." Now he grinned that stupid smug grin of his. "Where were <i>you</i>?"
      He laughed. "You were fucking hammered last night! Having a little too much
      fun?" With this he gave a few rabbit-like thrusts of his pelvis. </p><p>I was
      too worried about Haley to care. </p><p>"Who was the girl, Jason? Just tell
      me who the girl was."</p><p>"I told you I don''t know, Ashley. Maybe if you
      weren''t so shitfaced last night you could have found out for yourself."</p><p>In
      the briefest of moments I thought about the gun under Ian''s hoodie. But I wasn''t
      stupid. </p><p>I had to focus on getting home as soon as possible, then calling
      Danielle on the landline. All I cared about right now was making sure that Haley
      was okay. I tried to remind myself that there were probably hundreds of little
      girls at the fair last night. But if something had happened to Haley after she''d
      begged me to take her to the carnival, and I wasn''t there, I''d have to kill
      myself.</p><p>I had to stay calm. I had to. I couldn''t afford anything else.</p><p>"Look,"
      I said to Jason, trying to control my voice. "You know me. I''m obviously not
      a suspect. All you have to do is move that roadblock and let me through."</p><p>Jason
      didn''t stop leaning against my car. </p><p>He grinned. Again.</p><p>"What''s
      the rush?" he said. "I mean, I can''t let you out. I told you that. And, hell,
      I sure could use some company." Now he leaned in closer and lowered his voice.
      "Here I am, stuck out here all alone on a chilly evening. What''s the hurry?"
      He winked. "It''d be just like old times."</p><p>"Let me the fuck out." It was
      everything I could do not to scream. "Right now. Jason. Let me the fuck out.
      There''s no way this is even legal. Let me the fuck out right now."</p><p>Jason
      put his head through the open window and brought it close to mine. He sniffed.</p><p>"You
      been drinking? Ashley? Are you still drunk, maybe?" Now he put his finger under
      my chin and turned my face around toward his. He sniffed again. "I wonder if
      maybe you''re getting just a little belligerent. I wouldn''t want to have to
      detain you. But if I have to, I have to. It''d be for you own good."</p><p>I
      couldn''t even think. I hadn''t ever been so enraged in my life. I just acted
      without planning. Suddenly I found that I''d slammed my foot into the gas pedal.</p><p>My
      car heaved forward. Jason spun around, and the next thing I saw of him was just
      his hand flopping out through the window. I''m not sure, but I may have broken
      his arm. </p><p>I didn''t have much time to wonder about it, though, because
      my bumper hit the two wooden police barricades. I lurched forward with the impact,
      and I worried for a moment that I might not make it through. But I just kept
      my foot on the gas, and my little car surged, knocked the barriers aside, and
      sent them tumbling onto the road. </p><p>I looked into the rear-view mirror.
      </p><p>My taillights were just bright enough to illuminate Jason limping forward.
      He raised his gun with one hand. I ducked and kept speeding forward as fast
      as my car would go. But I was already too far away; he lowered his gun without
      firing, and I turned the corner onto the completely empty highway.</p><p>I drove
      faster and faster, trying to catch my breath, maxing out at a little over ninety
      miles an hour. The road was completely empty. The night was completely dark.
      </p><p>And then I felt it: someone''s hand on my shoulder. </p><p>For a moment
      I tried to reason that this was impossible, that maybe my seat belt had tightened
      when I''d crashed through the barricades. But I wasn''t wearing my seat belt.
      </p><p>Someone really was in the back of my car&mdash;had <i>been</i> <i>in</i>
      the back of my car this whole time&mdash;and now they were touching my shoulder.
      </p><p>I felt an index finger slowly rise up the skin on my neck. Very lightly,
      it touched my ear.</p><p>I was driving way too fast to take my eyes off the
      road. My car was shuddering from the speed. Without really thinking about it,
      I held on tight to the wheel and reached for Ian''s gun. I felt its metallic
      grip at the tips of my fingers.</p><p>But I didn''t grab it. </p><p>And this
      is what''s really weird. This is what I still can''t figure out. Because more
      than anything else I was truly afraid that Haley had been hurt, or worse. I
      was also consumed by worry that I may have cheated on Shawn last night. And
      now I was truly, utterly terrified at the fact that someone was in the back
      of my car, running their finger along the softest part of my neck. And yet,
      despite all of this, that weirdly euphoric sensation of invincibility that had
      overcome me after waking up still hadn''t gone away. If anything, it was suddenly
      becoming more intense.</p><p>Whoever was behind me drew their hand down over
      my shoulder, slowly across my ribs and abdomen, then plunged it, very softly,
      into my underwear.</p><p>I still had no idea who it was, or how I could be so
      weirdly aroused at a moment like this. I flashed on dancing with Bryce Tripp
      last night, and lighting my cigarette from his, and his icy blue eyes, and I
      wondered if only someone as confident as he was could do anything so audacious
      as this.</p><p>And then I remembered something else while still trying to slow
      my car down without wrecking it. It hadn''t been Morgan who''d talked Ian into
      having one more shot with us, like I''d thought earlier. It had been <i>me</i>.
      Morgan had been goading him, but it wasn''t until <i>I''d</i> spoken up that
      Ian finally glanced in my direction, and, for just a moment, gave me this accidental
      look that seemed to say <i>I''d do anything you ask me to do, anything at all</i>.
      Then he drank down his second shot. </p><p>I took my hand from the gun. </p><p>Instead,
      I clutched the fabric of Ian''s hoodie in the seat beside me.</p><p>Whoever
      it was in the back seat of my car right now, reaching even deeper into my underwear
      while I tried to keep the car on the road, it was probably more likely that
      it was anyone in the world other than Ian. </p><p>And yet no matter how well
      I knew it couldn''t possibly be him, for a moment I <i>hoped</i> somehow that
      it was.</p>'

      <p>I slept <i>so</i> well last night. I mean, yeah, I was terrified that I’d actually put the first part of my novel into the world. For a moment I worried that I’d made a huge mistake. I even almost took it down. After all, the story’s not exactly family friendly. Ha ha. But I’d been working crazy hard on writing it over the past week, and I was exhausted. I knew that people would probably hate my writing, but, still, after my moment of panic, I started to feel kinda good that I’d posted it as I drifted off. Really good, actually. Even if it was just on this blog. So I let myself feel a little happy.</p>

      <p>In case anyone actually starts reading this, I should probably say a little about who I am. That’s what you’re supposed to do, right? Well, I guess I'm just a girl from a small town who loves really good stories. My teacher told me I should try to publish my writing one day, so that’s what I’m trying to do — though suspense thrillers about a plague that turns people into crazed sex-fiends probably wasn't exactly what she had in mind! Ever since I learned about this stupid medical condition I came down with, though, I've been stuck at home without much else to do. And I really love writing. It's an escape, and it makes me feel better about things. I'll keep publishing new parts until the series ends — or until my dad finds out what I'm doing. (If he ever sees any of this, he'll kill me.)</p>

      <p>If by some miracle anyone out there starts reading this, it would be awesome to hear from you. Say hello in the comments section. </p>

      <p>I really wasn’t the kind of person who would ever act like this—or even <i>think</i> like this.</p>

      <p>First of all, I wouldn’t ever seriously consider sleeping around on my husband, even if maybe our marriage had fallen into a pretty deep rut. And I’m definitely not the kind of person who would ever actually get, well, just a little bit, um, <i>wet</i>, at the touch of a stranger’s hand on my shoulder. It was true that I <i>liked</i> sex, just like everybody else does. And for a while I really liked it, especially with Shawn when we were younger and things had been going well between us and we were like best friends. But I wouldn’t <i>ever</i> let anyone put their hand deep into my underwear while I was careening down a highway in the dark, probably not even Shawn in high school. And what I <i>absolutely</i> wouldn’t ever do while a stranger’s fingertip was beginning to press slightly inside me would be to actually <i>hope</i> that it was my sister’s husband who was doing it.</p>

      <p>Or at least I thought I wasn’t that kind of person. Not until now. And I wasn’t sure how I felt about it.</p>

      <p>A voice whispered behind me.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t what I expected. It wasn’t Ian’s voice, that’s for sure. And it definitely wasn’t any guy I knew.</p>

      <p>"You’re <i>wet</i>," it said.</p>

      <p>Then there was laughter. Shocked laughter. It was Morgan.</p>

      <p>"Oh my God!" she said, no longer whispering and now laughing out loud. She jerked her hand out of my pants. "You actually got a little into that, I think!"</p>

      <p>Finally I was able to slow the car to a reasonable speed and I quickly turned my head, just enough to glimpse the outline of Morgan’s face.</p>

      <p>"What the fuck are you doing?" I snapped my head back around to keep my eyes on the road, then glanced in the rear-view mirror. "Morgan! What are you doing in my car?"</p>

      <p>I was still so startled that I could barely process the fact that the person who had just had their hand down my pants had been my best friend. And it really weirded me out. So maybe one time at a lame-ass football party in high school some of the guys had pressured us into kissing each other, and we’d gone along just to prove we weren’t prudes. But otherwise Morgan had never done anything like this.</p>

      <p>She couldn’t stop laughing. "Who did you think I <i>was</i>!"</p>

      <p>"You scared the shit of me!" I said, trying to sound more annoyed than flustered and pretending I hadn’t been turned on. "Morgan? What the hell? I almost wrecked the car! Your hands are like ice! What the fuck are you doing in here?"</p>

      <p>"That was the funniest thing ever!" She kept laughing. "I thought you were so scared, at first. But obviously you weren’t <i>just</i> scared!"</p>

      <p>Still giggling, she climbed over the seat. I pulled Ian’s hoodie out of the way, careful to keep the gun wrapped inside, before she sat down.</p>

      <p>"But, wow, actually," she said, "I mean where did your tummy go? There’s like nothing there." She reached over and felt my abdomen. "I didn’t know you were trying to lose weight, Ash. Whatever you’re doing, it’s working."</p>

      <p>I was still flustered, and I couldn’t understand why Morgan would decide to hide in my car and then try to reach into my pants out of the blue. It was bizarre. Nothing was making any sense.</p>

      <p>"You’ve been spending too much time with Jason," I mumbled.</p>

      <p>But even Jason’s influence couldn’t quite explain how Morgan was acting. I was still basically clueless about whatever weird shit had been happening since last night, but obviously things had gone very wrong in Muldoon, and I had a feeling they were going to get worse. Yet Morgan was still laughing as if everything was perfectly normal and we’d just been out drinking together.</p>

      <p>"Can’t be because of Jason," she said, now catching her breath from laughing and settling into the passenger seat. "I broke it off with him last night. He definitely wasn’t happy about it. I’ve been avoiding him. Sorry I didn’t back you up just now. Really, Ash. I’m sorry. I just didn’t want him to see me in the car after everything." She slapped my arm with the back of her hand. "But that was crazy awesome what you just did! He’s such an ass hole! I bet he shit his pants when you broke through that roadblock. I mean, he should totally have to pay if you have to fix anything on your car. I bet you could even get him fired, after all that pervy shit he said to you."</p>

      <p>Morgan put her head in her hands. I could see by the dashboard lights that her hair was unbrushed, and that she was still wearing the same clothes she’d worn last night.</p>

      <p>We were quite the pair. She looked like she’d just woken up too.</p>

      <p>"I’m still so fucking hung over," she groaned, then she forced herself to straighten up. "So are you gonna tell me, or what?" she asked suddenly. "What happened to you last night? I was worried."</p>

      <p>I’d been hoping that it would be Morgan who could help <i>me</i> answer this question.</p>

      <p>I had no idea how much she knew, but I wasn’t quite ready to tell her that I’d completely blacked out and woke up in a room at the Starlight.</p>

      <p>"You first," I said. At least having Morgan in the car would help take my mind off worrying about Haley while I drove home. Now that I was recovering from her weird prank, I was actually feeling incredibly glad to see her. "How’d it go with you and Bryce Fancy-Ass Tripp?" I asked.</p>

      <p>"<i>Me?</i>" Morgan sounded genuinely surprised. "I couldn’t even get him to notice me," she said. "Not after we got to the bar, anyway. <i>You</i> were the one he couldn’t take his eyes off."</p>

      <p>"I doubt that," I said. "So I guess you didn’t get to see the inside of his bus?"</p>

      <p>"Seriously? <i>You</i> were the one who disappeared with him. You should have seen how worried Ian got before he went out looking for you." Morgan let out a little laugh. "But after how you were dancing with him, I gotta say. I’ve been telling you all this time to think about leaving Shawn, but I kinda thought maybe you were finally going for it. And, I mean, Bryce Tripp’s not a bad a way to do it."</p>

      <p>She glanced over at me.</p>

      <p>"Well, you know me." I shrugged. "I’m the good kid. You said it last night. I couldn’t do something like that to Shawn."</p>

      <p>I kept my eyes on the road. I could feel Morgan staring at me.</p>

      <p>"Okay," she said. "So, then, what <i>did</i> you do after we split up? I was looking for you. I was worried, Ash." </p>

      <p>"Worried? Why? I just ended up back at the beer garden for a little while."</p>

      <p>I didn’t like lying to Morgan, but I was too confused about what had actually happened to just tell her the truth. I’d explain later, after I’d got my bearings. She’d forgive me. I hoped.</p>

      <p>"Then after that," I said, "I was at the campground with some people I met from Boulder, or somewhere. I can hardly remember, actually. It’s your fault you got me so drunk. Then Ian found me and took me home."</p>

      <p>"Really," Morgan said, sounding suspicious. "Ian drove you home?"</p>

      <p>I wasn’t sure if she knew I was lying or if now she was trying to suggest that I had something going on with Ian.</p>

      <p>"But what about you?" I tugged at her unbuttoned jacket sleeve and laughed. "What did <i>you</i> get up to?"</p>

      <p>"Just stayed at the bar, pretty much. They actually ran out of beer on tap around one. So everyone just had more whiskey." She rubbed her eyes, then let out a long yawn. "When the police started making everyone leave, I couldn’t find you, and the phones were all jammed, so I just went to your car. I was gonna wait for you, then I guess I fell asleep. I tried to get out of the fairgrounds in the morning, but they wouldn’t let me. I was so hung over I just went back to your car and tried to sleep it off. I figured you’d show up eventually."</p>

      <p>"So do you have any idea what happened last night?" I asked. "I mean, have you heard anything new?"</p>

      <p>"Not a fucking clue. Some carney died at the high school, and later some kid got attacked at the fair." She shrugged. "That’s all anyone’s saying. I was kinda wondering if Ian filled you in on any of the details today. He must know more." Morgan had that same tone in her voice again when she mentioned Ian, but now I couldn’t tell if she was suspicious or feeling guilty about something she wasn't saying. "He didn’t say anything to you?"</p>

      <p>I thought about Ian’s Army hoodie and his gun in my car, and Morgan sleeping there. Had she been with him?</p>

      <p>Of course she hadn't. I didn’t know why my thoughts even went there.</p>

      <p>"I haven’t talked to Ian," I said, and I realized I had no idea if this was true or not.</p>

      <p>In a small town like Muldoon, word about anything gets out fast. Everyone at the bar last night already knew about the body at the high school. So it was hard to believe that no one seemed to know anything at all about the girl who’d been attacked, or who’d done it. I couldn’t figure out why the police would keep information like this secret. I also couldn’t figure out why they would be blocking people from going in <i>and</i> out of the fairgrounds. It didn’t make sense.</p>

      <p>My headlights reached a car parked on the side of the road up ahead. It was the first car I’d seen anywhere near the highway. Its taillights’ red glow dimly illuminated a hay field that stretched out into the darkness from the road.</p>

      <p>As I drew closer, I could see that both of the car’s front doors were wide open. I couldn’t make out what kind of car it was. As far as I could tell, no one was sitting inside, and I couldn’t see anyone standing around.</p>

      <p>Normally I would have slowed down in case someone was in trouble or hurt. But after everything that had been happening, the empty car was unnerving. I sped up just a little and passed it.</p>

      <p>Morgan watched the car out the window as we drove by, and now she turned around in her seat to look behind us.</p>

      <p>"What was that?" For some reason she was whispering. "Did you see that? Out in the field?"</p>

      <p>"What?"</p>

      <p>"Wait. Go back, go back. What was that? Something was out in the field."</p>

      <p>I really, really just wanted to go home. I wasn’t looking forward to confronting Shawn—I still had no idea what I was going to tell him about where I'd been last night. At least when I reached my house, though, I could call my sister and make sure Haley was safe. But I was born and raised in a small rural town, and in small rural towns you don’t just pass a car on the side of the road without making sure everything’s okay. What if someone needed help? If I was hurt on the side of the road and someone just drove by, I’d feel awful.</p>

      <p>I slowed down. I started to loop the car around to make a U-turn.</p>

      <p>"Hurry," Morgan whispered. She tapped the window, pointing into the darkness beyond the abandoned car. "Out there. Shine the lights out there."</p>

      <p>When I was about fifty yards from the parked car, I turned the wheel so the headlights would shine in the general direction Morgan had been pointing.</p>

      <p>It was a hay field. Pretty much just like any of the other thousands of hay fields in northern Colorado. The stubble was short. It had been cut recently. Big round bales of rolled hay were scattered as far as my headlights reached.</p>

      <p>"There! There!" Morgan yelled through her whispering voice. "Just turn back a little."</p>

      <p>I maneuvered my car so the headlights pointed toward the part of the field they’d just passed over.</p>

      <p>I searched the field again. But still I couldn’t see anything. There was just the abandoned car with its doors open and its lights on, and, out beyond, hundreds of hay bales.</p>

      <p>"Oh my <i>God</i>," Morgan whispered. "Who <i>is</i> that?"</p>

      <p>I still couldn’t see anything. The tone of Morgan’s voice was scaring me.</p>

      <p>"Where?"</p>

      <p>"<i>There!</i>"</p>

      <p>Morgan nodded stiffly toward the field as if she were trying to avoid making any fast movements.</p>

      <p>Finally I saw what she was looking at.</p>

      <p>I’d been scanning the field itself, searching for someone standing or maybe lying in the stubble. I hadn’t looked on top of the bales themselves. They were almost six feet tall, and I knew from experience as a kid that they weren’t easy to climb up onto.</p>

      <p>But someone had. Two people, in fact.</p>

      <p>On top of one of the bales, about three rows from the road, I could just make out a man’s back. It was bare. And there were a pair of equally bare women’s legs wrapped around him. From this distance I could just tell that they were swaying back and forth together.</p>

      <p>It had to have been a couple of high school kids having sex. They must have been enjoying themselves, because I was shining my headlights right toward them now, and they weren’t letting up.</p>

      <p>Morgan put her hand over her mouth and giggled. "Who <i>is</i> that?"</p>

      <p>"Just some kids," I said, not quite sharing Morgan’s interest. "Fair’s cancelled. What else are they going to do around here? Let’s go. Obviously our help isn’t exactly needed."</p>

      <p>"No, wait!" Morgan said, still giggling. "It isn’t kids! Look! Just pull up a little closer."</p>

      <p>I tried to look closer, but I couldn’t make out anything I hadn’t seen before. "I need to get home. I’m tired."</p>

      <p>"Just a little closer! Ash, seriously, it’s not kids." Morgan cupped her hands around her eyes and peered out the window. "Who <i>is </i>that?"</p>

      <p>I pulled up a little farther. I felt kind of guilty invading these people's privacy like this, but now I was curious about what Morgan thought she saw.</p>

      <p>I pulled within about thirty yards from the car.</p>

      <p>She was right. It definitely wasn’t kids. I could see the man’s back more clearly now. He was older. He was rhythmically thrusting away, then for a moment he threw his head back and I could see that his hair was gray. And so was the woman's.</p>

      <p>"Oh my God," Morgan squealed quietly. "They’re not even stopping! It’s like they don’t even see us. Can you tell who it is?" Morgan asked through a fit of suppressed giggling.</p>

      <p>The man threw his head back once again, the woman’s legs clutched tightly around his ass, and now he arched his back. They whole hay bale shuddered. </p>

      <p>"Oh god," I said, disgusted.</p>

      <p>"Can you tell who it is?" </p>

      <p>I had no idea. It was too far away to tell.</p>

      <p>The man rolled over onto his side, then his back, managing to keep his balance atop the hay bale. I couldn’t believe it, but now the woman threw her fleshy leg up and straddled him. She was plump, and her big ass shined white in the headlights.</p>

      <p>"Oh my <i>God</i>!" Morgan squealed. "They’re going again!"</p>

      <p>The woman just continued on swaying, completely oblivious to our presence, or, somehow, they just didn't care that we were there.</p>

      <p>What was going on? Something was off. I didn’t know any middle aged people who would ever act like this, especially not after everyone knew that someone had just died at the high school and half the town was under lockdown. And it wasn’t even a full moon.</p>

      <p>"What’s <i>happening</i> around here?" I said out loud.</p>

      <p>I was suddenly aware of the night's darkness surrounding the car. I also remembered the weirdly charged rush of erotic energy I felt when Morgan reached between my legs. </p>

      <p>I was scared. Something wasn’t right. I wasn’t sure what it was exactly, but I was scared. I needed to drop Morgan off, collect myself, and get things straightened out. In fact, what I really wanted to do was talk to Ian as soon as possible. Whatever was happening, he would know what to do better than anyone.</p>

      <p>I put my car in reverse, turned around, and started back down the highway.</p>

      <p>"Ashley!" Morgan pleaded. "I wanted to see who that was! I couldn’t even see the car."</p>

      <p>I kept driving.</p>

      <p>"Well, whatever." Morgan settled back into her seat. She was too hung over to put up much of a fight.</p>

      <p>For a moment she looked at me as I drove, and I could tell she was as perplexed as I was at everything that had been happening.</p>

      <p>She shook her head slowly. "What is <i>going on</i>?"</p>

      <p>Morgan lived in a tiny rental house on the Hershel ranch, the property that had abutted my family’s ranch for generations. </p>

      <p>When we were younger, sometimes Morgan and I used to sneak into the little clapboard house to drink. Mr. Hershel was one of those old classic grizzled cowboys, but he was really softhearted. He used to tear up whenever he had to slaughter cattle. He knew we used his house, and I’m sure he smelled the scent of cigarette smoke we left behind, but he never said anything to my parents about it. He even had the place fixed up a little before he started renting it to Morgan, and he charged her practically nothing.</p>

      <p>When I pulled up to drop Morgan off, I eyed the little house’s dark porch apprehensively.</p>

      <p>"Are you gonna be okay?" I asked her. "You can stay with me and Shawn, if you want. Maybe until everything settles down?"</p>

      <p>Morgan slapped my knee. "You’re a sweetheart," she said. "But I just want to get into my own bed and sleep. I’ll be fine."</p>

      <p>"You sure?"</p>

      <p>"Ash. Of course."</p>

      <p>She opened the door and stepped out.</p>

      <p>"Well," I said. "Call the house number if you need anything. I lost my phone."</p>

      <p>"Oh, shit," Morgan said. "Really?" Then she laughed. "What a night. I’ll be fine. Call me tomorrow."</p>

      <p>She closed the car door. I kept my headlights shining on her porch until she was inside and had the lights turned on.</p>

      <p>The house I rent with Shawn isn’t far past my parents’ ranch. I was there in a couple of minutes. </p>

      <p>None of the lights were on. My house was as dark as Morgan’s.</p>

      <p>Shawn’s pickup must have been inside the garage, because the driveway was empty. I hurried to the house.</p>

      <p>The door was locked.</p>

      <p>We almost never locked our front door. I knocked.</p>

      <p>I waited. I knocked again, louder, and this time I called Shawn’s name.</p>

      <p>Nothing. My husband wasn’t home.</p>

      <p>Shawn was <i>always</i> at home if he wasn’t working.</p>

      <p>I tried not to panic. I’d been so apprehensive about confronting him that I’d just assumed he’d be there.</p>

      <p>I got back into my car and drove straight to Ian and Danielle’s house, which was only a couple of miles past ours.</p>

      <p>But there were no lights on at their place either. Their door was locked too, and when I knocked I was met only with a deep, disquieting silence.</p>

      <p>I suddenly regretted not making Morgan come home with me. I don’t think I’d ever felt more alone. The sky was perfectly clear and moonless, and all of the stars shined down on me icily as I walked back to my little car.</p>

      <p>My parents’ house was my last bet. I tried not to think about the possibility of finding their place abandoned and silent too.</p>

      <p>I drove all the way back up the highway, still not passing a single car.</p>

      <p>I turned of the road and drove under the big <i>Travis Ranch</i> sign spanning the dirt road. I’d always thought the sign was so tacky and worn out, but now I found it mildly comforting in the dark of night.</p>

      <p>The old farmhouse I grew up in sits just over a low rise. When followed the road up the hillside, the house’s upstairs windows became visible first. None of them were lit. I braced myself.</p>

      <p>But as I reached the top of the rise, I could see vehicles crowding my parents’ driveway. The front porch light was on. Shawn’s truck was there, and so was Ian’s SUV.</p>

      <p>I’d never been so happy to be home. I sped down the driveway and pulled up behind my dad’s hay truck.</p>

      <p>Then I remembered Haley, and what had happened last night.</p>

      <p>What if everyone had gathered here at my mom and dad’s because it really had been Haley who’d been attacked at the fair? What if she’d been hurt, or worse? And what if while all this had gone on while I’d been out partying, sleeping around with who knew who, and out of reach all day?</p>

      <p>I knew I was probably overreacting, but I ran up the steps and threw open the front door. I burst through the entryway.</p>

      <p>The first thing I saw was Haley, lying at the bottom of the staircase.</p>

      <p>Her head was resting against the lowest stairs. She was in her pajamas.</p>

      <p>In each of her hands was a small bronze horse. These were the prizes at the horse racing pinball game at the fair. Every time you won, you traded up for a bigger horse. My parents must have taken her to the carnival last night, then brought her home, as planned, safe a sound, long before the attack.</p>

      <p>"Aunt Ashley!"</p>

      <p>My niece sprang to her feet and ran towards me, a toy horse in each hand.</p>

      <p>"She’s here!" Haley shouted. "Aunt Ashley’s here!"</p>

      <p>I knelt down and right away, before even hugging me, Haley sat on my knee.</p>

      <p>"Look," she said, carefully displaying her pair of bronze horses as if they were small birds perched in her hands. "I got one, and grandpa got one." She whispered, "But he gave his to me."</p>

      <p>My dad rushed into the entryway.</p>

      <p>I’d never seen him look this way. He had this expression of utter relief when he saw me. I’d had no idea what I’d been putting them all through.</p>

      <p>He was in the same kind of striped farmer’s shirt and faded jeans he always wore, his boots off in the house, and his eyes were misty as he strode toward me and put his arms around me. I could smell the hay dust on him, just like I always could whenever he used to hug me.</p>

      <p>"Oh, thank God," he said. "You’re here. You’re here."</p>

      <p>Now my mom appeared, and right behind her came Danielle and Ian. Even Tyler slouched over for my big return.</p>

      <p>Everyone had been waiting for me. I hadn’t even considered that anyone besides Shawn would know I’d been gone.</p>

      <p>My dad let go of me, and now my mom stepped forward, her arms folded. I could tell she was waging an inner battle between feeling relieved and being totally pissed at me, and it looked like the being-totally-pissed-at-me side was winning.</p>

      <p>"I sure hope you have a good explanation for all this," she said. My mom was small, but tough, especially during moments when she had to be emotionally strong. She gave me a quick hug, then she held on to both of my shoulders. "Do you know how worried Shawn’s been?" she whispered, glancing upstairs. "I’ve never seen him so sick with worry."</p>

      <p>Just then my husband appeared at the top of the stairs.</p>

      <p>He looked almost as if he’d been crying, and he was as pale as he’d been in the locker room the night before. His expression actually reminded me of the days after his accident, and the endless months he'd spent in the hospital with pins holding his spinal column together.</p>

      <p>He didn’t say anything. For a moment he just stared down at me, folding his arms around his now-pudgy frame, and I just stared back up at him, not knowing what to say, and everyone else just watched silently. I realized I’d been holding out hope that somehow, for some reason, it would turn out that it had been Shawn who I’d been with in the motel last night. I’d hoped that we’d both gotten so drunk that maybe on whim we’d just run off to the Starlight to make up for all the lost intimacy we’d been missing.</p>

      <p>But now even that remote possibility was gone. If Shawn had been worrying about me all day, that meant he didn't know I was at the motel. I’d cheated on him. I still had no idea who I’d slept with last night, but now I was sure that it wasn’t my husband.</p>

      <p>I didn’t know what else to do other than to just start talking. I couldn’t stand everyone just staring at us. There was no way I could tell my family the truth, so I started making things up which I hoped were half-way believable.</p>

      <p>"I got stuck inside the fairgrounds," I explained. "I’m so sorry. I realized I’d left my phone at the bar when they started evacuating everyone." My whole family just kept staring at me, listening, so I just kept talking. "I ran back to look for my phone, but the police wouldn’t even let me back into the Buckshot. By the time I made it all the way back to my car, they were already closing up the gates at the fairground. They wouldn’t let me out. I had to sleep in my car. It was only this evening when I finally talked Jason Gibbs into letting me leave." I glanced up at Shawn, who had now sat down at the top of the staircase. "I have no idea what’s going on around here." I felt myself starting to cry, but I got control of myself. I swallowed and took a deep breath. "I haven’t even really talked to anyone all day. I don’t understand. What’s been happening?"</p>

      <p>My mom was feeling a little more generous now. She gave me her signature sideways hug and started rubbing my shoulder. Ian cleared his throat.</p>

      <p>"Tyler," Ian said. "Take your sister upstairs please."</p>

      <p>"Why?" Haley asked.</p>

      <p>Ian didn’t say anything. He just raised his eyebrows sternly and Haley immediately dashed upstairs. Tyler followed. Ian took me by the shoulder.</p>

      <p>"Let’s go outside," he said.</p>

      <p>I let him lead me out the door. We sat on the porch swing.</p>

      <p>"We don’t know much more than you do about what's going on, Ash. To be honest. There’s a lot we don’t know. It’s not good though. I can tell you that much. It’s not just the fairgrounds and the high school. There are roadblocks on all the highways coming in and out of town. I haven’t been able to get any answers." He turned around and looked into the house. He was obviously worried about his kids. "There’s not a damn thing on the news," he whispered. "None of the stations have picked anything up yet."</p>

      <p>"They won’t let any of us leave town? At all?" I knew things were going badly, but I never dreamed it could be as big as this. "How is that even legal?"</p>

      <p>"It’s not," Ian said. "But they’re doing it."</p>

      <p>"Why, though?" I asked. "I don’t understand. Just to find this guy who attacked a little girl? I mean, obviously they have to catch him, but none of this makes sense."</p>

      <p>Ian leaned back in the chair and took a deep breath. I could feel the weight of his body in the sway of the porch swing. He glanced inside the house again and lowered his voice even further. </p>

      <p>"It’s not just that, Ash. They’ve got that little girl at the hospital. The one who was attacked. When I went back there last night there were armed guards all around her room. These guys were from way out of town. Maybe out of state. Not cops, military. Some kind of Special Ops or something." Ian lowered his voice even further. "And they got him. They got the guy. They killed him. They already <i>killed</i> the guy who attacked the girl."</p>

      <p>Ian stared at me for a second, unsure what to say, maybe unsure if he’d told me too much already. I knew he hadn’t shared any of this with Danielle. And, honestly, I wasn’t sure why he was telling me.</p>

      <p>"So, what’s this mean?" I asked, keeping my voice low. "What’s going on then?"</p>

      <p>"All I can say is that I’m sure there’s a lot more going on than we know at this point."</p>

      <p>I started to cry. I couldn’t hold it back any more. Ian didn’t try to comfort me, which I was thankful for. He just sat there as the tears spilled down my cheeks and I tried to process everything he was telling me. I still didn’t understand what all of this meant, but for some reason it made me feel even more guilty about cheating on Shawn. It felt like such a small and stupid thing to have done, especially now. And I was worried that Ian knew more than he was telling me.</p>

      <p>"I blacked out last night," I confessed at last. "There are a lot of hours I don’t remember at all. The truth is I don’t remember much of anything after the bar." I turned to look at him. "But I found your stuff in my car."</p>

      <p>Ian searched my eyes. There was something in his look that told me he definitely <i>did </i>know more than he was saying, but he also looked almost relieved when I told him I'd blacked out.</p>

      <p>"You don’t remember anything at all?" he asked.</p>

      <p>"I’m so stupid." I tried to dry my eyes. "I haven’t drunk that much since high school. Everything’s pretty much a complete blank."</p>

      <p>"I went out looking for you after you disappeared at the bar," Ian said. "I couldn’t find you anywhere. To be honest, I think I was even more worried than Shawn’s been."</p>

      <p>He wouldn’t look at me. Ian just kept folding and unfolding his hands and staring at them. He cleared his throat.</p>

      <p>"After they starting evacuating everyone," he whispered, "I was worried about you. Really worried. You know? I didn’t have time to go to the motel, so I looked for your car in the lot." He shrugged. "I figured eventually you’d make it back to your car. I didn’t want you to be cold. And I wanted to make sure you'd be safe. You still have the gun, right?"</p>

      <p>I nodded.</p>

      <p>"Good."</p>

      <p>Ian's phone rang while he nodded back distractedly.</p>

      <p>I was used to Ian always getting calls, but this time when the ringer chimed it really startled me.</p>

      <p>I saw the name for the incoming call flash on the screen before he picked up.</p>

      <p>It was Morgan.</p>

      <p>She was screaming. She was screaming so loud I could hear her the sound of her voice as soon as Ian answered. She was screaming for help. </p>

      <p>We jumped into my little car. It was blocking all the other cars in; we had no choice but to use mine.</p>

      <p>I got into the passenger’s seat to let Ian drive, which was a good thing, because he flew around the dirt-road corners way faster than I’d ever be able go without losing control and rolling.</p>

      <p>I had to hold tight to the handle grip around every turn all the way there. Still, I managed to pull Ian’s gun from where I’d stashed it between the seats. I had no idea if the safety was on or off, but I held on to the gun as tightly as I held onto the car.</p>

      <p>Somehow, in the middle of all of this, I flashed on what he’d just said to me on the porch swing.</p>

      <p>He’d said he stashed the gun in my car because he<i> didn’t have time to go to the motel</i>.</p>

      <p>"How did you know I was at the motel?" I asked as he skidded onto the long driveway leading to Morgan’s house.</p>

      <p>"What?"</p>

      <p>"You said you <i>didn’t have time to go to the motel</i> before leaving the gun in my car," I yelled over the sound of the gravel hitting the wheel wells.</p>

      <p>"Ashley, I didn’t know where you were. I said I couldn’t find you."</p>

      <p>"You said something about a motel!"</p>

      <p>He was racing toward Morgan’s house, and we were almost there, but he took his eyes off the road just long enough to give me a hard look.</p>

      <p>"Listen to me," he said decisively. "I don’t care what I may have said. I don’t know anything about any motel."</p>

      <p>We skidded right up to Morgan’s gate. We both leapt out of the car and raced up the front steps. The house lights were on. I didn’t loosen my grip on the gun for a second.</p>

      <p>Morgan was still screaming. But her cries were more ragged now, more tired and defeated.</p>

      <p>As we passed through the living room I made sure the safety was off. I knew that I would have to shoot whoever was making my best friend wail with such an awful, suffering sound. I couldn’t even let myself think what Morgan must have been going through, or what exactly was happening to her. I just knew I was prepared to kill whoever was causing her to make that sound.</p>

      <p>She was in the bedroom. We could hear her crying out from behind the door, but it was locked. </p>

      <p>Ian slammed his shoulder into the door, and the wood splintered, but it stayed shut. He backed up and slammed into it again, even harder this time, and now the handle broke out of the frame.</p>

      <p>The door whipped open.</p>

      <p>Only twenty-four hours earlier I’d helped Ian carry a dead body whose penis had been gruesomely mutilated. But what I saw in Morgan’s room was more horrifying than anything I’d ever seen. It was horrifying on so many levels that at first my brain just kind of shut down and I didn’t understand what I was seeing.</p>

      <p>Morgan was on her back, lying atop her tiny writing desk, and bent backwards in what looked like an excruciatingly painful position.</p>

      <p>She was completely naked. And she was bleeding. Her nose was covered in blood; her eyebrow was split. Patches of smeared blood ran from her face, down over her breasts, and all the way to her pubic hair. </p>

      <p>And standing over her was Mr. Hershel.</p>

      <p>I could barely comprehend that this was the same man who my mom always called the "gentle cowboy," who had been my closest neighbor throughout my childhood, who had even once taught me how to ride his old graying mare.</p>

      <p>And he too was completely naked. Or almost completely naked. As he spun around to see who had just crashed through the door, he was wearing just an old leather holster. The belt was fastened around his otherwise bare hips, and inside the holster pouch, which was dangling down against his thigh, was no six-shooter but a very modern-looking handgun.</p>

      <p>Morgan’s blood soaked his tanned, weathered face and his bare white chest. And his penis was erect. It was standing upright so that its pointy head hovered just in front of his belt buckle.</p>

      <p>I gagged. But I didn’t drop the gun.</p>

      <p>Morgan was still crying out in agony, which I hoped was a good sign only because she hadn’t yet been beaten unconscious. But there was absolutely no question that Mr. Hershel had been raping her. </p>

      <p>Now he planted a leathery hand between her breasts, holding her down, and Morgan screamed again. Mr. Hershel was fast, but his movements were feverishly stilted. It was almost as though someone were controlling him with strings. He kept fiercely twitching his head to one side and stamping his heel as though his entire body were itching.</p>

      <p>But with his free hand, he drew his gun and pointed it right my face.</p>

      <p>Ian dove at him.</p>

      <p>Before Ian’s shoulder reached Mr. Hershel’s chest, Mr. Hershel fired his gun.</p>

      <p>For a moment I was sure he’d hit Ian in the top of his head, but he must have missed, because as Mr. Hershel toppled backward under the weight of Ian’s body blow, Ian immediately tried to wrestle the gun from his blood-soaked hand.</p>

      <p>Mr. Hershel didn’t utter a word. He just kept breathing at the pace of a dog’s panting, without stopping. His whole body was heaving with every breath.</p>

      <p>Before Ian was able to pry the gun from his fingers, Mr. Hershel pulled away and brought the butt of his gun down hard right behind Ian’s ear.</p>

      <p>Ian tumbled backwards, dazed, and fell at my feet.</p>

      <p>I knew this was it. I knew this was the moment I had to pull the trigger. I was already aiming right between Mr. Hershel’s eyes.</p>

      <p>But I couldn’t do it. Whatever strength I’d summoned to help Ian carry the mutilated body from the locker room without vomiting was all the strength I possessed. This was different. This was too much.</p>

      <p>Mr. Hershel grabbed onto Morgan’s ankle and pulled her off the table. She cried out again as she fell awkwardly on her shoulder. She made a muted, coughing cry as she hit the floor. Mr. Hershel held tightly to her foot, twisting her leg up away from her body like he was dragging a club.</p>

      <p>And still I couldn’t pull the trigger.</p>

      <p>I was so ashamed. As certain as I’d been a moment earlier that I was going to kill whoever I found hurting Morgan, now I was just as certain that I couldn’t bring myself to end the life of the man I’d grown up next door to, no matter what he was doing.</p>

      <p>I felt myself letting out a sob.</p>

      <p>I heard the heavy blast of Mr. Hershel’s gun.</p>

      <p>I was sure, in the next moment, that I was dead. Everything was black. I was lying on the floor. </p>

      <p>But not because I’d been shot. Mr. Hershel hadn’t even fired his gun. This fact dawned on me slowly as I opened my eyes.</p>

      <p>What had happened was that Ian had grabbed the gun from my hand, knocking me over in the process, and had shot Mr. Hershel.</p>

      <p>A massive wound had opened up on his shoulder.</p>

      <p>But as if nothing had happened to him at all, Mr. Hershel lunged at Ian, toppling him over. Now he held Ian down, pinning him on his back. Mr. Hershel raised his gun once more, this time with a new urgency and rage.</p>

      <p>He brought the barrel level with Ian’s eyes. But at the same instant Ian stabbed his own gun up under Mr. Hershel’s chin and fired.</p>

      <p>There was an abrupt, compacted explosion. A piece of Mr. Hershel’s skull leapt up into the air and landed wetly on Morgan’s bed.</p>

      <p>Mr. Hershel slumped. Ian pushed the now limp body away, and it fell in a semi-sitting position against the desk.</p>

      <p>Ian got on his feet and slid to Morgan’s side.</p>

      <p>"You’re okay," he said. "You’re okay. Everything’s going to be okay now. Everything’s all over."</p>

      <p>Morgan stared blankly around the room, never quite meeting Ian’s eyes and looking too utterly confused and in too much pain to cry, or even to begin to try to speak.</p>

      <p>Ian pulled the comforter from her bed and wrapped it around her bloodied body. One of her eyes was almost swollen shut, and she was starting to shiver. He picked her up and carried her toward my car while I followed close behind.</p>

      <p>He turned to me as he eased Morgan out the front door, careful not to let her head bump the doorframe.</p>

      <p>"Can you get her some clothes?" he asked me. It was hard to comprehend such a practical request right now. "We’ll take her back to the house, but she’ll need some clothes."</p>

      <p>"Yes," I said. "Yes. I can"</p>

      <p>I hurried back through the house and stepped once again into Morgan’s room.</p>

      <p>Mr. Hershel’s body lay partly propped up with its back against the writing desk. I tried not to look at it.</p>

      <p>But I couldn’t help it. I especially couldn’t help but notice Mr. Hershel's penis.</p>

      <p>It was still strangely erect. It hadn’t subsided at all. Not throughout the entire fight with Ian, and not even after he’d been shot in the head.</p>

      <p>And his testicles, I noticed only now, were swollen and blackened, just like the corpse in the locker room.</p>

      <p>His head was pitched forward over one shoulder. I tried not to look at the gaping wound. I didn’t think I could handle actually seeing the brain matter.</p>

      <p>But it wasn’t exactly brain matter that I glimpsed inside his shattered skull. Just when I was about to force myself to look away, I saw . . . movement. There was something happening—some kind of slow <i>churning</i>—inside Mr. Hershel's head.</p>

      <p>I took half a step closer. </p>

      <p>Inside the skull cavity was a mass of larvae.</p>

      <p>Hundreds, thousands, maybe more, were spinning and twisting around in a thick bunch. Each larva was pale white, almost translucent, and about the width of a fingernail. A few had started to spill out of the gunshot wound, plinking down onto the blood-soaked carpet and writhing there.</p>

      <p>"Ian!" I called. I tried to take a breath, but I couldn’t breathe. "Ian!"</p>

      <p>I realized I wasn’t calling out at all, but whispering. I couldn’t speak. Another pair of larvae fell from Mr. Hershel’s head and landed softly on the carpet.</p>

      <p>I turned away from the body. I closed my eyes and forced myself to breathe. I just had to get Morgan’s clothes, and then I could leave.</p>

      <p>I jerked open all of her drawers. I grabbed a few pairs of underwear, socks, and the first tops I could find. All she needed was something to cover up with; it didn’t matter what. As soon as I found a couple pairs of jeans, I wrapped everything up in an oversized t-shirt.</p>

      <p>Morgan’s phone was on the dresser, so I grabbed that too and left the room as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p>Just as I stepped out onto the porch, the phone rang in my hand.</p>

      <p><i>Ashley</i> flashed on the screen. Someone was calling from <i>my</i> phone.</p>

      <p>"Who is this?" I snapped, in an irrational mixture of overflowing confusion and fear.</p>

      <p>"Whoa!" said a male voice. "Everything okay? Is this Morgan?"</p>

      <p>"Who <i>is</i> this?" I repeated. "This is Ashley. You have my phone."</p>

      <p>"It’s Bryce. Ashley, it’s Bryce. I ended up grabbing your phone after last night. I’m so sorry, it’s the same model as mine. I wanted to get it back to you."</p>

      <p>I was approaching my car now, but I stopped short at the front gate.</p>

      <p>Even after everything I’d just witnessed, what I saw now was even more surprising.</p>

      <p>I had no idea what to think. I dropped the phone.</p>

      <p>In my car’s front seat, dimly lit by the overhead light, Ian was holding Morgan tightly in the comforter.</p>

      <p>But she had placed both of her hands, gently, at either side of his face.</p>

      <p>And she was kissing him.</p>

      <p>I can’t believe I actually finished writing Part 2 before the weekend! I had to stay up all night to do it, but I finished way ahead of schedule. </p>

      <p>And a few of you actually messaged my twitter account this week! I REALLY want to thank everyone so much who’s written to me with all the encouragement. It means a lot to me. </p>

      <p>I actually have to say how all this happened, this time. Because it was kind of crazy. </p>

      <p>So, my dad—he’s like, really strict—found out that I’d stayed up all night finishing Part 2. Or, he sort of found out.</p>

      <p>His rule is "lights out" at 10:30pm. I’d turned my bedroom light off by then, but I ended up staying up much later than I’d planned writing in bed on my laptop. I really wanted to finish a draft.</p>

      <p>My dad always gets up for work at 4:30, and I didn’t even realize how late it had gotten. He must have heard me typing or something, because he knew right away that I’d been up on my computer all night. He doesn’t let me have a lock on my door, so he can just open it. When he looked in, I didn’t have time to close my laptop or pull my covers over my head. But I’m really lucky that I always keep my Facebook page up, and at least I had time to open my web browser as fast as I could before he looked at my screen and saw what I was really working on. </p>

      <p>My dad doesn’t really know what Facebook is, or how it works. I kind of lied and suggested I’d been on Facebook all night. He got all pissed, and he gave me this lecture about how important it is for me to get sleep, and how me and all my friends are addicted to the internet.</p>

      <p>So, for my "punishment," he turned off our internet connection. I know it’s stupid, and it doesn’t really make sense, but that’s what he did, because I "need to know that there are consequences" if I "choose to stay up all night on Facebook." Blaaghh.</p>

      <p>But, luckily, Kyle totally saved me. ("Kyle" isn’t really his name, just like "Bailey Simms" isn’t my real name, but I kind of have to keep all of this private so I don’t get caught.) He’s this really sweet guy in the class ahead of me. He’s not exactly my boyfriend, just this really nice, really good guy who I sort of grew up with. Ever since I’ve had to stay home from school for my treatments, he’s been like my best friend, even if we mostly just talk on the phone and text.</p>

      <p>Anyway, his parents just got him an iPad, and it has this Hotspot thing where you can use an iPad as a Wi-Fi router. I told him my dad turned off our internet, but I didn’t tell him what I needed it for. (I haven’t told a single person that I’ve started this blog.) I only told him that I had a bunch of Facebook messages to respond to, which I did, but really I mostly wanted to post the next part of my novel.</p>

      <p>He’s so sweet, he didn’t even ask any questions. He just drove up to my house and parked his car across the street. He knew he wouldn’t be able to see me. He just called me from his car and told me he would sit there with his iPad Hotspot turned on as long as I needed to use the Wi-Fi, then he gave me the password. I never expected he would do anything like that. </p>

      <p>So, anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, "Kyle." You’re really the best. I honestly don’t know what I’d do without you. It’s honestly the best part of my day when you call me. I know you can’t read this because I haven’t told you about this novel yet. But without you, I wouldn’t have been able to publish this installment at all. So this one’s for you. </p>

      <p>. . . Okay, I better hurry up and post this so he doesn’t have to sit out there forever waiting for my slow ass to finish using his Hotspot. As always, thanks for reading! I’m @BaileySimms. Tweet me! I’m actually kinda nice! </p>

      <p>xxBailey</p>

    - Fifty Shades of Gangrene
    - '<p><span class="first_letter">I</span> woke up in a motel room I''d never seen.
      No matter how hard I''ve thought about it since, I have no memory of how I got
      there or what happened the night before.</p><p>There were beer bottles all over
      the side table, not to mention a completely empty eighth of Jack Daniels. What
      looked like some kind of fancy foreign wine bottle, also drained, was filled
      with cigarette butts. The TV, one of those old boxy sets, had fallen back against
      the wall, and in the corner an arm chair was lying on its side. Feathers were
      everywhere; one of the pillows had been torn open.</p><p>I was pretty sure I
      was alone. No one was in bed with me. When I leaned over to check the floor
      I saw only more feathers and more beer bottles scattered across the carpet&mdash;along
      with my clothes. All of them. My jeans were in a pile against the wall with
      my underwear still bunched inside. My bra hung over the one arm chair that was
      still standing.</p><p>I was totally naked. And I''d definitely had sex. I was
      sore, and not just a little. I hadn''t felt like this since Shawn and I were
      in high school and going at it like rabbits senior year.</p><p>But we hadn''t
      had sex in months, as far as I could remember.</p><p>I tried not to think about
      the fact that there was no good reason I would have needed to check into a motel
      if it was my husband I''d had sex with.</p><p>And yet despite my fear about
      whatever it was I''d done that night, and despite my apparent blackout, and
      the pervasive smell of stale cigarettes&mdash;and some other smell too, I noticed
      now, something faintly rancid&mdash;I felt, well . . . <i>great</i>.</p><p>It
      was as if I''d been sleeping for days and had woken up completely refreshed.
      I didn''t have the slightest headache, not a hint of nausea. I practically bounced
      out of bed. When I pulled on my pants I felt like I had the energy to race up
      a mountain.</p><p>But I still couldn''t remember anything.</p><p>Other than
      the bottles everywhere, there was no evidence of whoever else had been with
      me in the room. The only clothes I''d found on the floor had been mine, and
      the bathroom was empty. All that was in the mini-bar fridge, weirdly, was an
      empty gallon milk container.<p><p>I looked under the bed and checked my pockets,
      but I couldn''t find my phone. So I couldn''t even look at my recent calls.
      Had I lost it, or had someone stolen it? I had no idea.</p><p>It was a beautiful
      day outside, but when I stepped into what I recognized now as the parking lot
      of the Starlight Motel, I realized that it wasn''t morning. The sun was already
      starting to set. Apparently I''d slept all afternoon.</p><p>Now that I was out
      in the fresh air, things started to come back to me about the day before, if
      not the night.</p> <p>Suddenly I remembered what Ian and I had found at the
      high school.</p><p>I remembered how I''d helped carry it. I remembered the stench,
      and how afterward I couldn''t quite wash off the smell. I wondered if maybe
      that''s what I''d been smelling inside the motel room.</p><p>I also remembered
      why my car was nowhere to be seen. I live in Muldoon, Colorado, and if you haven''t
      heard of it, you''re basically like everybody else in the world who isn''t from
      Muldoon. We don''t even have a stop light. It''s that small. The only thing
      that ever happens is the fair, once a year. The kids sell their livestock, there''s
      a carnival and a rodeo, and everyone pretty much has an excuse to get drunk
      all weekend.</p><p>I do the books at this trucking company whose office is right
      across from the fairgrounds. I usually park in the lot there, and when I got
      off work early yesterday there was this huge bus blocking my car. It was emblazoned
      with a massive <i>Bryce Tripp</i> logo. He''s supposed to be this up-and-coming
      country star, but, honestly, I hadn''t heard of him before a few days ago. (How
      big could he really be if he was giving a concert at the Muldoon fair?) The
      people in charge of his bus must have been waiting to get into the rodeo grounds
      where his concert was going to be, but I couldn''t find the driver anywhere.
      I couldn''t even reach my husband because the cell phones were already jammed
      from everyone arriving from out of town.</p><p>So I''d asked my boss for a ride
      home; I remembered now. I''d figured I''d worry about my car later. I hadn''t
      really needed it anyway then because Ian, my brother in law, was supposed to
      give me and Shawn a ride to the fair that night so we could drink, then he was
      going to bring us home later.</p><p>That had been the plan anyway.</p><p/>Now
      I was at the Starlight Motel, alone, without a car or phone, and still no memory
      at all of how I got there</p> <br><p><span class="new_section_first_letter">I</span>
      tried to go back and piece together everything that had happened the previous
      day as best as I could. </p><p>First, I remembered that when my boss dropped
      me at home, Shawn was already there, watching TV, as usual. His station at the
      couch was pretty much the only place he spent time lately when he wasn''t at
      work. He has a shift at the mill, which I know can be exhausting, but it''d
      been months since he''d been out. And lately he''d started saying he didn''t
      want me to go out with any of my friends alone. One of the reasons I''d been
      looking forward to the fair for weeks was that Shawn wouldn''t have any choice
      but to get off his ass and go somewhere. I''d been hoping that maybe we could
      have a little fun again, for once.</p><p>"I''m getting in the shower," I called
      out, competing with the blare of Sports Center. "Ian''s gonna be here in an
      hour, remember?"</p><p>After a moment, Shawn yelled back. </p><p>"Tonight? We''ll
      go tomorrow," he said. "No one really shows up until Saturday anyway."</p><p>I
      should have seen this coming. If my husband never wanted to go out at all anymore,
      why would he ever go out for two nights in a row without complaining about it?
      I''d thought things would be different during fair, but I guess I''d been wrong.</p><p>I
      tried not to sound too irritated. "Everyone always goes tonight." I leaned into
      the living room and found myself talking to the back of my husband''s head.
      He was only twenty-six, but his hair was just beginning to thin. "All your friends
      are going. And mine. Morgan''s already there waiting for me. And Ian''s coming
      all the way back in the middle of Tyler''s football game just to give us a ride.
      It would be weird if you didn''t go."</p><p>I stepped into the bathroom and
      turned on the shower before Shawn could respond. I hoped that by putting myself
      out of earshot he would give up and agree to just go without a fight. </p><p>While
      I undressed, I forced myself to look at the mirror. I''d definitely put on a
      little weight since high school, but not as much as Shawn had, especially after
      his accident. But I looked okay, I decided. Nothing like Morgan, who''d somehow
      stayed as skinny as she was at sixteen. But at least I looked okay. </p><p>While
      the water warmed up, without really meaning to, I started considering what my
      night out would be like if Shawn <i>did </i>just stay at home. I thought about
      having the chance to ride into town with Ian alone. I thought about doing shots
      with Morgan, just the two of us. Maybe it wouldn''t have been the worst thing
      after all if Shawn didn''t come. In the middle of washing my hair, I actually
      started seriously considered persuading him to stay home. </p><p>But by the
      time I got out of the shower I could hear him changing from his work clothes,
      and I decided not to say anything. I couldn''t. Not after I''d already talked
      him into going. I''d feel too guilty if I did something like that, anyway. Besides,
      it would probably be good for us to get drunk together. </p><p>Ian pulled up
      to the house just as I was finishing with my makeup. I wore this new low-cut
      top I''d bought just for the fair and my tightest pair of jeans. Maybe it wasn''t
      exactly what they were wearing in Denver these days, but not bad for the Muldoon
      fair. </p><p>I could tell my brother-in-law was in a hurry to get back before
      the end of the high school football game, but he was too polite to say so. As
      we came out of the house Ian kept his truck idling, sauntered over to Shawn,
      and slapped his shoulder.</p><p>"Hey, buddy, you all ready for tonight?"</p><p>"Yup,"
      Shawn said. As always, Shawn was a little quiet and intimidated by Ian. "Ready
      to go."</p><p>"Hiya, sis!" Ian gave me a quick hug, then just as quickly he
      let me go and hopped back into his pickup. </p><p>Ian was in a good mood. On
      the way over he told us that Tyler got a touchdown, and besides being happy
      that his son had played well, he was looking forward to being out at the fair
      tonight too. I could tell. </p><p>"You sure you''re okay not drinking?" I asked
      him. "I''m glad I''m not the one stuck driving." </p><p>I was glad Ian had offered
      to give us a ride, but the truth is I also liked how Ian got after a couple
      drinks. He''d been a medic in Iraq, and now he worked as an EMT at our tiny
      local hospital. When he got back from the war I used to worry he''d break down
      or something if he drank, but he never did. Mostly he just got less serious
      and his sense of humor would come out. I''d laugh at his wry jokes, and he always
      laughed along with me in this kind and warmly boyish way he had. He''s actually
      really attractive&mdash;way more attractive than Shawn&mdash;but sometimes I
      think my sister doesn''t even realize this.</p><p>"Who says I can''t have a
      beer?" Ian winked at me. "It''s fair time. I''ll nurse one for a little while."
      He nudged Shawn''s arm. "Just don''t tell Danielle."</p><p>I knew Ian really
      wouldn''t have any more than one drink. I don''t think I know anyone who''s
      more responsible. Besides, if he did, my sister would find out one way or another
      and kill him. </p><p>I was about to ask whether he was taking Haley, his youngest,
      to the carnival tonight, but that''s when Ian''s phone rang.</p><p>The gruff,
      semi-garbled voice on the speakerphone must have been a hospital dispatcher,
      but I couldn''t make out who it was. "Ian, you there at the school?" the voice
      asked. </p><p>"Just left," Ian said.</p><p>"I guess someone had a fall in the
      girl''s shower, or something. We just got a call from Bernice, but couldn''t
      quite make out what she was saying. The ambulance is still here at the hospital.
      We''re wrapping up Toby''s ankle now."</p><p>Ian switched off the speaker and
      brought the phone to his ear. "Yeah, I''ll be there in a couple minutes." </p><p>He
      hung up.</p><p>"That Toby Hollis kid sprained his ankle pretty bad in the first
      quarter," he told us. "Ambulance is still tied up wit him. You don''t mind if
      we make a little detour, do you? It''s probably nothing, but I gotta check it
      out."</p><p>"That''s alright," I said. </p><p>But in truth I was feeling selfish
      and a little disappointed that Ian couldn''t just drop us at the fairgrounds.
      What kind of town only had one ambulance? I guess Ian''s SUV was the sole backup.
      </p><p>Ian pulled right up to the door of the girl''s locker room. The second
      half of the football game had already started. I could hear the hum of the crowd
      over at the field, but the gym was deserted. Shawn stepped from the pickup,
      but in an old high-school habit he was hesitant about going into the girls''
      locker room, which I thought was kind of sadly funny, as if he were still just
      a kid. </p><p>Ian was in a hurry. "Come on in, if you want," he told us. "We''re
      a little understaffed." He laughed. "Maybe you could give me a hand, if I need
      it."</p><p>I hadn''t stepped into the locker room for years. Bernice Whipple,
      my old P.E. teacher, was even there. It was like she lived there. </p><p>"Hey,
      Mrs. Whipple." I gave her my best version of a friendly wave. But she didn''t
      even register my presence. </p><p>She was distraught, expressionless. She went
      right for Ian. She grabbed his jacket, then she led him toward the showers.</p><p>"Here,"
      she said, whispering. "Here. It''s here."</p><p>I followed behind, trying to
      stay out of the way.</p><p>When I first saw what was on the tile floor&mdash;the
      same place I''d stood showering a hundred times in high school&mdash;I thought
      maybe some kid was playing a joke, trying to scare the cheerleaders or something.
      </p><p>There were shards of broken glass all over the shower, and, right above,
      one of the big frosted windows had been broken out. </p><p>There wasn''t any
      blood. Just a person, naked, face down. It wasn''t a high-schooler at all, but
      a grown man, his bare ass in the air, his skin unnaturally pale from head to
      foot. </p><p>He was very obviously not alive. </p><p>I''d never seen a dead
      body before, not ever. But I was sure that no living person could lie that perfectly
      still. </p><p>This definitely wasn''t what Ian had expected when he''d invited
      us in. He rushed to the body and knelt beside it. In what seemed like one motion,
      he opened his medical bag and snapped on a blue latex glove. He pinched one
      of the body''s wrists, gently, checking for a pulse I guess, but he must not
      have got what he needed because he put on the other glove, grabbed one of the
      shoulders, and turned the whole body over.</p><p>It jostled onto its back and
      lay face up. </p><p>I didn''t think I recognized whoever it was, but the face
      was so sunken and gray I wasn''t sure. To me, it looked like someone that had
      been dead for a long time, weeks maybe. But I guess I don''t know anything about
      how bodies decay&mdash;the cheerleaders must have used the locker room only
      a couple of hours earlier, and the body couldn''t have been in the shower then.
      </p><p>Ian touched the body''s throat, again checking for a pulse which I knew
      wouldn''t be there. </p><p>I''d been so distracted by the deteriorated face,
      it was only now that I noticed what Ian was staring at. He and everyone else.
      </p><p>Mrs. Whipple was letting out this long-winded weeping sound and starting
      to cry. </p><p>Ian glanced at me, obviously regretting that he''d let me and
      Shawn come inside, but now there wasn''t anything he could do about it. He returned
      his attention to the body, maybe not entirely sure what to do next.</p><p>It
      was missing its penis. Where the penis should have been was just this short
      fleshy stump. The wound was raggedly scabbed over and looked infected. </p><p>I
      was so stunned that I didn''t even feel sick, not even when I saw what was below
      the missing penis: two baseball-sized spheres of tightly swollen flesh. They
      were the testicles, puffed up unnaturally and darkened to a deep, blackish purple,
      like a pair of giant toxic mushrooms. </p><p>I could hear Shawn breathing heavily
      behind me. I worried he was about to pass out and I wouldn''t know what to do.</p><p>"Holy
      fuck," he whispered. </p><p>In the middle of all of this, Ian''s phone rang.
      He fumbled to answer it. </p><p>He listened. "Yeah, it''s here," he said. I
      could tell it was the hospital dispatcher again. "<i>Now</i> you tell me," Ian
      said, exasperated, then he paused. "Right now?" Another pause. "That''s not
      how we do things. I don''t care who&mdash;" He stopped and listened again. After
      a minute, reluctantly he said, "Well, I guess. I guess if that''s what they
      say. I don''t know. I''ll do what I can. Jesus."</p><p>Ian stood and turned
      away from us. For a moment he just held his wrist to his head, apparently trying
      to figure out what to do. Outside, in the distance, the football game''s final
      buzzer sounded over the loudspeakers.</p><p>"Shit." </p><p>Finally Ian turned
      toward us. </p><p>"We have to get this out of here right now." He gave my husband
      a hard look. "Shawn, buddy. I hate to ask you to do this. But I need a hand.
      I can''t get it into my rig on my own. I got pretty strict orders to clear this
      out before the crowd comes through after the game." He nodded in the general
      direction of the football field. "And everyone''s on their way now."</p><p>Shawn
      was silent. He took one step backwards, then he threw up all over a changing
      bench. </p><p>Instinctively I put a hand on my husband''s back while he retched.
      I didn''t know what else to do. I glanced at Ian. He looked completely at a
      loss.</p><p>"I''ll help," I said. "I''ll do it."</p><p>I stepped toward the
      body before I could lose my nerve. Ian looked extremely uncomfortable, but I
      could tell he knew he didn''t have any other choice but to accept my help. </p><p>"Shit,
      Ashley," he began, "you don''t..." </p><p>"I can do it." I said. </p><p>I pulled
      two gloves from the cardboard box in Ian''s medical bag and put them on.</p><p>"Shit,"
      he said, again.</p><p>"Just tell me what to do. What do I do?"</p><p>Ian took
      a deep breath. "Alright. Shit. You take the ankles. It''s not far. Let''s just
      hurry and get this over with. God damn it, Ash. I owe you."</p><p>I tried not
      to think about what I was doing. I tried to tell myself that this was no different
      than a dead animal, or a dummy. </p><p>But as I clutched the body''s ankles,
      the tendons and bones beneath the skin felt so human and lifelike that I started
      to feel dizzy. I tried to breathe, but I hadn''t expected the smell to be so
      strong. It was definitely the smell of rotten flesh. I wondered if maybe the
      rancid smell was coming from the swollen testicles; they did look like they
      were rotting or maybe turning gangrenous.</p><p>I had to do something to distract
      myself so I wouldn''t throw up. I was desperate not to let Ian down. I knew
      that my sister wouldn''t be able to do this, and somewhere deep inside I''d
      always understood that Danielle couldn''t ever really let herself imagine what
      Ian must have gone through in the war. I wondered if by helping him now, in
      this unlikely way, maybe I could somehow acknowledge what my sister couldn''t.</p><p>"What
      do you think happened to him?" I asked Ian. </p><p>I didn''t actually care what
      had happened, not at that moment. But I couldn''t think of any other way to
      get my mind off the smell and the body''s sagging, loose weight in my hands
      as we shuffled through the locker room.</p><p>"I have no idea," Ian whispered.
      "He must have been trying to peep through the window. And then I guess he fell
      through the glass."</p><p>"But what about...?" I started. "Why is it missing?"
      </p><p>If I could barely bring myself to ask about the missing penis, I couldn''t
      even begin to mention the bloated testicles. They appeared at the point of bursting
      as the body swayed between us.</p><p>Ian gave me a look of total perplexity
      and shook his head. "I have <i>no</i> fucking idea."</p><p>"It''s one of those
      carnies!" Mrs. Whipple was still crying, but she was in control enough to make
      this last proclamation as she held the locker room door open for us, shuddering.
      "They''re all on drugs!" </p><p>The hardest part was lifting the body into the
      back of Ian''s SUV. </p><p>Ian laid the shoulders on the tailgate while I kept
      ahold of the ankles. I''d managed to control my nausea, but now my arms were
      burning. I didn''t even want to think about letting the body drop, or the sound
      of it hitting the pavement. Ian climbed into the back and pulled the shoulders
      from the inside, and finally I could let go. I looked around the dark lot outside
      the gym. I didn''t think anyone saw us, but I could hear the crowd from the
      game moving in our direction.</p><p>"You okay?" Ian asked.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>"I''m
      real sorry, Ash," he whispered. "Really."</p><p>"It''s okay." I tried to smile.
      "I fucking need a drink," I laughed, "but I''m okay."</p><p>Now Ian laughed
      too, obviously relieved that I''d been able to handle it. Maybe he was even
      a little impressed. </p><p>After laughing, though, he added earnestly, "Technically
      you weren''t supposed to see any of this. Right?"</p><p>"Right," I nodded. "Of
      course. Okay."</p><br><p><span class="new_section_first_letter">I</span> helped
      Shawn wash the splattered vomit off his shoes while Mrs. Whipple hurried to
      sweep up the broken glass. </p><p>I bought Shawn a Sprite from the vending machine,
      which he said helped his stomach, but I had to hurry him out of the locker room
      before the cheerleaders arrived. </p><p>By now everyone who had been watching
      the football game was passing through the parking lot on their way to the fair.
      No one seemed to have a clue about what had just happened. My sister was there
      with Haley, waiting for Tyler to finish showering. </p><p>"They won! Tyler scored!"
      Danielle waved to us. She had no idea what had just happened. "What are you
      guys doing here? I thought Ian was taking you straight to the beer garden."</p><p>"He
      got called to the hospital on the way, so he dropped us here." </p><p>Technically
      I wasn''t lying. I wasn''t sure what Ian did or didn''t want me to say, even
      to my sister.</p><p>Haley skipped over to me, obviously totally hopped up on
      excitement for the fair. I remembered feeling the same way when I was a kid.</p><p>"Aunt
      Ashley!" She slammed into me and gave me a hug. I hugged her back tentatively.
      I''d washed my hands and arms three times in the locker room, but I was still
      hesitant to touch my niece after what I''d just done. "Are you going with me
      to the carnival tonight?" she pleaded.</p><p>"Tomorrow!" I said. </p><p>It was
      so hard to say no to Haley. Over the last couple of years my niece had turned
      into this blonde-haired, wide-eyed kid, kind of small for her age, just like
      I''d been at nine. I got to play the role of the fun, slightly reckless aunt
      when I was with her. Last year at the fair we''d spent hours playing the same
      pin-ball horse racing carnival game I used to be addicted to as a kid, and I''d
      taught her how to cheat by tipping the machine. </p><p>But there was no way
      I was going to do anything tonight other than have a drink as soon as possible&mdash;an
      even stiffer one than I''d planned on earlier.</p><p>"But I want to play the
      horses!" Ashley whined.</p><p>Danielle cut in, saving me. "Aunt Ashley and Uncle
      Shawn are having an adults'' night tonight," she announced. "Grandma and Grandpa
      will take you to the horses."</p><p>Haley looked up at me, pouting, which was
      annoying but still I felt guilty for letting her down.</p><p>"Tomorrow we''ll
      play the horses," I promised. "Just you and me."</p><p>"You guys want a ride
      over?" Danielle asked. "Tyler''s still gonna be a while."</p><p>"I feel like
      a walk," I said. "Maybe I''ll see you over there."</p><p>It felt weird just
      traipsing off to the fair after everything that had happened. Someone had just
      died, and I''d just helped carry his body in my hands. It all felt completely
      unreal. I guess the right thing to do would have been to just go home, have
      a sober, contemplative evening, and try to make sense of what had happened.
      But I couldn''t imagine anything worse than being stuck alone with Shawn way
      out there in our quiet little house. I needed to be around people, a lot of
      them. I needed to get rid of the image of the mutilated body. I could still
      feel its weight in my arms. I was also really hoping to catch up with Ian later
      and find out if he''d learned anything about who the guy was, or what had happened
      to him before falling into the locker room, or why we''d had to rush the body
      away so fast.</p><p>Shawn and I joined the crowd making its way to the fairgrounds.
      I kept expecting him to object to continuing on to the fair, but he just walked
      along beside me silently, still pretty pale in the face. </p><p>"How are you?"
      I asked, folding my arms against the September evening air.</p><p>"Fine," he
      said. "I''m fine."</p><p>He didn''t really look at me. </p><p>I knew he was
      embarrassed that I''d had to be the one to help Ian. This is why he wasn''t
      saying anything. He would have been too ashamed to insist on running home now
      if I wasn''t suggesting it first. Or maybe he also just really wanted a drink.</p><br><p><span
      class="new_section_first_letter">W</span>hen we reached the beer garden, Morgan
      wasn''t even there yet. She was always late. I should have known. </p><p>I texted
      her, and she replied right back. </p><p>"<i>b ther soon wait 4 me.</i>"</p><p>So
      there was nothing to do now but wait around with Shawn''s friends, who of course
      had been at the beer garden for at least an hour by then.</p><p>Jason Gibbs
      was already mostly drunk. Right away he bought me and Shawn a beer. </p><p>Jason
      was a few years younger than us. I even used to babysit him. In high school,
      he was the basketball star, but of course no one from Muldoon ever gets a scholarship
      anywhere so he''d worked at the mill for a while with Shawn. Now he was a highway
      patrol cop; I had no idea how he''d gotten the night off. He was always a little
      shit as a kid. He used to try to take Polaroids of me peeing from outside their
      bathroom window. For a while, though, I''d hoped that maybe he''d influence
      Shawn to go to the patrol academy too, and I guess I still did, so mostly I
      tolerated him as one of my husband''s friends.</p><p>Shawn drank his beer down
      as fast as I''d ever seen him drink. I bought the next round, getting a vodka
      tonic for myself this time.</p><p>"Whoa, Ashley!" Jason pressed his plastic
      beer cup into my drink. "Somebody''s partying tonight!"</p><p>"It''s been a
      long day," I confessed.</p><p>Jason tapped Shawn''s arm. "You better watch your
      wife, bro. It''s fair time. She keeps going like that, might end up with somebody
      else''s dick in her ass. Not saying whose, I''m just saying."</p><p>Shawn finished
      the last of his second beer. "You might end up with somebody''s dick down your
      throat, dude," he said. Some of his color had come back. "And I''m saying whose.
      Mine."</p><p>"Charming, as ever," I said to both of them. But I didn''t mind
      that Shawn had actually sort of stuck up for me, even if it was by threatening
      his friend with forced fellatio in the middle of ordering more beer.</p><p>I
      tried to express as much of my annoyance with Jason as possible, but I was distracted
      by the way his long, horsey face was capped by whatever spiked thing he was
      trying to do with his hair. A couple of strands actually kept bobbing up a down
      whenever he laughed, which I don''t think he was aware of.</p><p>"I don''t know,
      bro," Jason said, now without taking his eyes off me. "We have a history, me
      and Ashley. She told you didn''t she? She used to beg my parents to go out of
      town. I had the biggest cock of all the kids she babysat for. When they got
      home, she used to be, like, ‘No Mr. And Mrs. Gibbs, you don''t owe me anything.
      Little Jason took care of all my needs.'' Your wife''s a nympho, bro! Seriously!"</p><p>Apparently
      my husband thought the high-pitched voice Jason used to impersonate me was the
      funniest thing in the world. Shawn was laughing, and now Jason started laughing
      at his own joke, and this only made Shawn laugh harder. Apparently this was
      how much easier it was for Shawn to put the locker room out of his mind than
      it was for me.</p><p>"No, dude!" Shawn said. "You don''t even know! I mean,
      she kind of <i>is</i> a nympho!" My husband laughed hilariously at this revelation.</p><p>All
      I''d wanted was to have a drink and to try to calm down a little. And now I
      had to deal with this. </p><p>The worst part was that I didn''t even know what
      to say. I thought about bringing up how I knew Jason used to whack off to Tina
      Frame''s picture in the yearbook, but I didn''t have it in me. I was too mentally
      fried, and I didn''t care. I just sat there shaking my head like some prudish
      idiot.</p><p>"Ashleeeey!" Morgan''s arms suddenly wrapped around me from behind.
      She almost knocked me off my barstool.</p><p>I stood and hugged her back, spilling
      my drink. "Where the hell have you been?"</p><p>Morgan was already completely
      tanked. She gave me a big, whiskey-tainted kiss on the cheek. It was weird how
      happy I was to see her. For a moment I almost started to cry. </p><p>"<i>You</i>
      and <i>me</i>," Morgan said, shaking her hips with each word in a little drunken
      dance, "are going <i>to</i> ..."&mdash;she held up the back of her wrist, stamped
      with a green <i>T</i>&mdash;"the Bryce Tripp concert!"</p><p>Jason scoffed.
      "Bryce Drip''s a fucking faggot."</p><p>"And we''re leaving these two <i>losers"</i>&mdash;Morgan
      traced a circle in the air, then pointed at Jason''s and Shawn''s faces&mdash;"right
      here in the fucking <i>lame ass</i> beer garden." </p><p>Morgan displayed her
      stamped wrist again, then tilted her head coyly, held out her tongue, and, like
      an inebriated pole dancer, gave her stamped wrist a long, sexy lick. </p><p>Jason
      glanced at Shawn. </p><p>Now Morgan grabbed my wrist and pressed it against
      hers, transferring the green <i>T</i> concert stamp to my wrist, just like we
      used to do years ago to sneak one of us into the movie theater.</p><p>Before
      I could finish the last of my drink, Morgan was pulling me away by the hand.
      I didn''t even so much as wave to Shawn before leaving him there.</p><p>On the
      way through the carnival, Morgan hung on my shoulder and whispered, "I''ve been
      sleeping with Jason." She made a gagging sound. "Gross, huh! I know, I know!"</p><p>I
      was surprised. "Morgan!" She had this great body, but I''d always been the one
      with the more-or-less cute face. She was always trying to prove that she was
      attractive by sleeping with one guy or another. But I hadn''t expected she''d
      sleep with Jason. "Why him?"</p><p>"It''s okay, Ash," she said. "Because I''m
      already cheating on him!" Morgan snorted a laugh. "Don''t tell him! It''s way
      more fun cheating on him than it is sleeping with him!"</p><p>I couldn''t help
      but laugh with her. </p><p>"You''re fucking crazy," I said. I was actually feeling
      a little better. </p><p>As we passed the Tilt-A-Whirl I whispered, "So who are
      you cheating on him with, then?"</p><p>She held a finger to her lips. "Shhhhh.
      Not saying."</p><p>"Who? Tell me."</p><p>"Not saying!"</p><p>Morgan bounded
      ahead. I had no idea who her mystery man was, but I worried it might be someone
      married if she wouldn''t tell me. Knowing Morgan, though, I''d find out one
      way or another before too long. She never kept a secret.</p><p>She was already
      through the concert gates, waving at me to follow her in. </p><p>Suddenly I
      flashed on the body in the locker room, again. I''d actually managed to forget
      about it for a little while, but now the image of its mouth hanging open came
      back to me. I''d kept glimpsing its teeth while I''d helped Ian carry it. </p><p>For
      some reason this made me nervous about sneaking into the concert. We weren''t
      kids any more, and I''d be mortified if I got caught now, as an adult, especially
      tonight. I even knew the woman collecting tickets and checking stamps. Her husband
      was one of the truckers at the company I worked for. </p><p>Morgan gave me a
      shrug from the other side of the gate. Then she impatiently waved me in again.
      </p><p>"Hurry up!" she yelled.</p><p>I stepped forward, trying to keep as far
      from the counter as possible, holding up my wrist with its faint green <i>T</i>.
      I''d never been as good as Morgan was at playing things cool. </p><p>Of course
      the woman collecting tickets recognized me. </p><p>"Ashley! Hi! I thought you
      weren''t going to the concert?"</p><p>"Hey Helen," I smiled, scared; she already
      suspected me, I could tell. "Well, my friend bought me a ticket," I said awkwardly.
      "We came in earlier? I just went out for a sec to say hi to my niece."</p><p>I
      had no idea where these lies were coming from, or how believable they were.</p><p>"Well
      let''s see that stamp of yours."</p><p>My heart was pounding. This was so stupid.
      Someone had just died and I was about to get caught sneaking into a concert
      by some musician I''d never even heard of and whose bus had blocked my car in.
      </p><p>"I''m gonna be late!" I joked nervously.</p><p>Helen took my hand and
      examined the stamp. This was it. I glanced around. What would she do? Were there
      security guards she would call? I saw one guy, arms folded, standing at the
      entrance to the grandstands. I was pretty sure he was already looking over at
      me.</p><p>"That''s what I thought!" Helen declared, inspecting my stamp. "Ashley!"
      She frowned and clucked her tongue. "You''ve almost worn your stamp off already!
      I can barely see it. Here." She plunked her rubber stamp into the inkpad and
      gave me a fresh <i>T. </i>"Enjoy!"</p><p>As soon as I was through the gate,
      Morgan grabbed my arm and hurried me toward to the grandstands. </p><p>"You
      totally thought fucking Helen Sandburg was going to arrest you or something,
      didn''t you!" She laughed at me. "I saw the look on your face! You did! Always
      such a <i>good kid</i>." She squeezed my neck. "Ah, that''s why I love you."</p><p>I
      hated that Morgan thought about me that way. But it was true. I let that ass-hole
      Jason treat me like shit. I let Shawn belittle me after I''d just wiped vomit
      off his shoes. And now I was afraid that sweet wouldn''t-accuse-a-fly-of-buzzing
      Helen would turn me into the cops. It was a good thing Morgan loved me, however
      innocent she thought I was.</p><p>I was suddenly determined to get completely
      wasted.</p><p>The concert was packed. It was disorienting to see the rodeo grounds
      transformed into a country music venue and filled with so many people from out
      of town. I led Morgan all the way to the standing-only area in front of the
      stage. We must have missed all the opening acts because Bryce Tripp himself
      was already playing. He was sitting on a stool wearing boots and a sleeveless
      shirt, looking like an underwear model with a guitar and a cowboy hat. I thought
      maybe he was even wearing makeup. </p><p>He was singing some ballad that nobody
      seemed to know except for a small group of middle-aged women I didn''t recognize,
      each holding up a cigarette lighter and swaying idiotically. </p><p>Pretty much
      everybody else was at least as drunk as they were, but more restless. A couple
      of guys I recognized from Biggs, the next town over, started yelling at the
      stage.</p><p>"Hey dick lick! Pick it up, pretty boy! Fucking slow!"</p><p>Bryce
      Tripp seemed to get the hint. Next song he called out his backup band, slung
      on an electric guitar, and started playing a much faster song whose only lyrics
      I could catch were "beer" and "bullets." </p><p>Half the crowd was down in front
      of the stage dancing drunkenly. Morgan bought beers and managed to pour a shot''s-worth
      each of whiskey from her purse flask. "Boilermakers!" She yelled over the speakers.
      </p><p>I could tell already that the concert wasn''t going to end well. There
      was just this feeling in the air. Too many guys who basically wanted to drink,
      and drink more, and then break whatever rule they could find to break. Halfway
      into his set, Bryce Tripp slowed it down again, this time playing a crooning
      love song. A guy nearby took the opportunity to slow-dance with this girl I
      vaguely recognized from the beer garden. He had his hands all over her, then
      he started really grabbing her ass. I was pretty sure she''d been with somebody
      else at the beer garden. It was actually kind of weird how the guy wasn''t just
      grabbing her ass but totally reaching around and down between her legs, and
      she was just letting him go at it.</p><p>That''s when I got knocked over. </p><p>Some
      guy had trampled into me, fists swinging. As I fell, his elbow caught me behind
      the ear. I spilled what was left of my second boilermaker and scraped my palm.
      </p><p>"Ass hole!" Morgan screamed and tried to help me up.</p><p>This was just
      as the guy who''d knocked me down&mdash;it was the same guy I''d seen with the
      girl in the beer garden&mdash;punched the guy she was dancing with squarely
      in the face. But then yet another guy I''d never seen before pushed them both
      right back into us, and we got knocked over again. </p><p>An all-out brawl broke
      lose. </p><p>Morgan and I crawled to the edge of the stage, and Bryce Tripp
      finally stopped playing. A security guard took over the microphone while a handful
      of rent-a-cops tried to stop the melee. I checked my palm, which was only barely
      bleeding, and my head, which felt fine, but this may have had a lot to do with
      how drunk I was at that point.</p><p>When I looked up, Morgan was talking to
      Bryce Tripp. I couldn''t believe it.</p><p>"Why''d you stop playing?" she yelled
      out while the scuffle continued on, barely abated, behind her.</p><p>I was sure
      Bryce Tripp would just ignore her, but he actually smiled and said something.
      Neither of us could make it out over the bullhorn. </p><p>"What?" Morgan screamed.
      I hadn''t seen her this drunk in a long time.</p><p>Bryce Tripp smiled again
      and shook his head. I couldn''t believe it, but he actually approached us at
      the foot of the stage and kneeled down to talk to us.</p><p>"They won''t let
      me keep playing," he said. "It''s actually in my contract." </p><p>He had these
      crazy icy-blue eyes. I honestly don''t think I''d ever seen anyone better looking
      from this close, in person. </p><p>"You know," he added, and shrugged. "The
      ‘safety of the performer at risk'' and all that."</p><p>Morgan was in full flirting
      mode. "So you always do what <i>they</i> tell you to do?" </p><p>She has this
      weird ability to flirt without making a total ass of herself, no matter how
      drunk she is.</p><p>Bryce Tripp laughed. He was even cuter with a full grin.
      I actually felt this wave of attraction pass over me when he spoke. </p><p>"Yeah,"
      he nodded. "I usually do pretty much what they tell me."</p><p>Morgan put on
      a pout and pretended like she''d lost interest. "Well, that''s a shame."</p><p>"No,
      not really," Bryce Tripp shot back, still grinning. "I get paid all the same.
      This is my third brawl in two months. Just means I get the night off. Which
      is fine by me."</p><p>He stood, reached into his pocket, and pulled out a stack
      of what looked like business cards. </p><p>"Couple of backstage passes," he
      said, handing one to Morgan and one to me. "Looks like I''m free for the evening.
      Why don''t you come on over and say hello."</p><p>Then he just gave us this
      friendly wave and left.</p><p>As soon as he''d left the stage, Morgan clutched
      her pass and screamed.</p><p>"Oh my fucking God! How do we get back there?"</p><p>There
      was a little security gate beside the stage which seemed to be the only way
      in.</p><p>By then the brawl had shifted toward the grandstands and we were able
      to make our move. We had to avoid an inebriated trucker pinned to the ground
      by a couple of security cops, but we managed to race to the side of the stage
      without getting knocked over again. </p><p>I couldn''t stop laughing. I hadn''t
      forgotten the body, but I was so drunk by now, I actually didn''t care that
      someone had just died.</p><p>This little panicking security guard was the only
      person manning the backstage gate. He was so focused on the brawl, standing
      on his toes and yelling into his cell phone, that he just waved us in without
      even really looking at our passes. He was probably used to letting local girls
      with passes backstage.</p><p>The area behind the stage was strangely empty.
      There were these couches set up outside, and a cold-cut buffet, and coolers
      of what I assumed to be beer, but no one was around. Bryce Tripp''s trailer&mdash;the
      same one that had blocked my car&mdash;was now pulled up alongside this sitting
      area. </p><p>But Bryce Tripp himself was nowhere to be seen. I don''t know what
      I expected, but not this. </p><p>Morgan grabbed a beer from a cooler and sat
      on the couch. </p><p>Just then someone came out of the trailer. A guy. He was
      dressed in tapered jeans and a fitted shirt and looked ready for an L.A. nightclub.
      </p><p>He lowered his sunglasses, and it was only now that I realized fully
      that this was Bryce Tripp, the same guy who''d just been singing twangy country
      songs in a Stetson.</p><p>"How do you like my disguise?" he asked.</p><p>"I
      can''t say it''s an improvement," Morgan said.</p><p>He folded his glasses and
      stashed them in his vest pocket. </p><p>"So where we going?" he asked. "If I''m
      going to buy you drinks, you two have to lead the way. I''ve never been here
      before. Where are we, anyway? Muldoon? Is that what it''s called?"</p><p>"Muldoon,"
      I confirmed, stupidly.</p><p>Morgan laughed. "Which means there''s only one
      place to go! Come on."</p><br><p><span class="new_section_first_letter">T</span>he
      Buckshot Bar is the single establishment where you can buy beer on tap year-round
      in Muldoon. During fair time it never closes, and it''s basically standing-room-only,
      twenty-four hours a day, all weekend.</p><p>I don''t think anyone recognized
      Bryce Tripp when we came in. He turned the head of just about every girl he
      passed when we all made our way inside, and at least a dozen half-sozzled guys
      sized him up. But he looked so different out of his western clothes that no
      one realized he was the same guy on all the concert posters. Everyone figured
      he was just someone''s out-of-towner friend, some pretty boy from the city.</p><p>"Well,
      ladies," he said, wedging himself into a place at the bar between me and Morgan
      on one said and Tuck Schroep, my second-grade teacher''s husband, on the other.
      "What''ll it be?" </p><p>I was already barely able to keep my balance, but I
      let him order me a whiskey. </p><p>It was while I was doing the shot that I
      saw Shawn at the back of the bar. He was nodding drunkenly at one of his friends
      from the mill.</p><p>For just a moment I worried he''d see me shoulder-to-shoulder
      with this extremely attractive stranger, the only guy in the bar in skinny jeans,
      and get upset. </p><p>But in exactly the next moment, I <i>hoped</i> he''d see
      me. I thought again about his complete inability to help Ian with the body in
      the locker room, and the way he''d laughed at me with Jason. Fuck him. </p><p>"Nate!"
      I yelled at the bar tender, pounding my hand and drawing as much attention to
      myself as possible. "Three more Maker''s!"</p><p>I had no idea if this worked
      because I lost sight of Shawn while a surge of a dozen people spilled in from
      the cancelled concert. I''m sure the bar was well past its legal capacity. I
      could hardly breathe. </p><p>By the time our next round arrived, Tuck Schroep
      was talking at Bryce and Morgan from beneath his hairy white mustache. </p><p>"Clean
      off!" he was saying, making a chopping motion with his hand. "That''s right.
      I''m telling you. Somebody''d cut his thingy clean off!"</p><p>I realized he
      was talking about the body. </p><p>I knew the news of a mutilated corpse in
      the girls'' locker room was going to spread like prairie fire, but not this
      fast. Mrs. Whipple must have told anyone within earshot after the football game.
      </p><p>And now everyone was on edge. I could tell. People weren''t just drinking
      because it was fair time. People were nervous, afraid. Things like this didn''t
      ever happen in Muldoon. I''d never even seen Tuck Schroep drunk before, not
      ever, come to think of it.</p><p>"What''s he talking about!" Bryce laughed.
      He couldn''t seem to figure out if Tuck was crazy or not.</p><p>"I don''t know,"
      I lied. I was desperate to come up with a way to change the subject. Before
      I could think of how, though, Tuck broke in again.</p><p>"He was trying to rape
      one of the girls, I guess!" he declared. "One of the cheerleaders. I don''t
      know which one of them cut it off, but one of ‘em did. Well, good for them,
      I say."</p><p>Someone put a hand on my shoulder. At first I thought it was someone
      trying to pay Nate, but whoever it was kept his hand there and pulled a little,
      gently turning me around.</p><p>"How you holding up?"</p><p>It was Ian. </p><p>I
      practically knocked Morgan over hugging him. "You''re already here! I didn''t
      think I''d see you."</p><p>He looked at me a little warily. He''d changed clothes;
      he''d probably showered. He was wearing his Army hoodie. He glanced at Bryce,
      then back at me. </p><p>"How you holding up?" he asked again.</p><p>"Fine!"
      I yelled over the bar''s noise. "Fine! Totally fine. Drunk off my ass, but fine!"</p><p>Bryce
      Tripp held out his hand. "Hey I''m Bryce," he said, charmingly.</p><p>Ian shook
      his hand. He was polite, but wary. "Ian." </p><p>I was actually pretty drunk
      at that point, but I could see right away that Ian was the only person in the
      bar who recognized Bryce Tripp from the posters. </p><p>"Buy you a drink?" Bryce
      asked him.</p><p>"Nate!" Morgan yelled before Ian could respond. "Four more!"</p><p>Ian
      grinned at me for the first time since he''d said hello. </p><p>"I did say I
      might have just one."</p><p>Bryce raised his shot glass. "Well, then, to&mdash;where
      are we? Muldoon! Prettiest little place I''ve ever avoided getting my ass kicked.
      So far." </p><p>Morgan laughed, we all clinked Bryce''s glass with ours, and
      I drank down yet another whiskey&mdash;who knows how many by that point. </p><p>After
      that point, things start to get hazy.</p><p>I remember Morgan talking to Ian
      about bear hunting with her dad, and Ian just nodding and listening to her drunken
      blather because he was too nice to tell her just to shut the fuck up. I remember
      actually grabbing Bryce Tripp''s arm and peeling him away from Tuck Schroep&mdash;something
      I never would have done if I hadn''t been so totally wasted&mdash;and staggering
      with him in tow onto the insanely crowded dance floor. I think I remember Shawn
      watching us dancing, but I can''t say for certain.</p><p>Next, I remember&mdash;just
      barely&mdash;asking Bryce if he smoked, and then I remember him buying cigarettes
      from the vending machine. I think I remember having one more shot at the bar
      and going outside to smoke, and I''m pretty sure I remember that Morgan actually
      talked Ian into having another shot with us. There was another moment outside&mdash;this
      one very hazy&mdash;when Bryce bummed someone''s last match, and he laughed
      when I told him he''d have to monkeyfuck me, which meant, I explained, lighting
      my cigarette from his. But I can barely remember this at all, and I can''t really
      say if it was before or after that round of shots with Morgan and Ian.</p><p>And
      that''s it, really. </p><p>The rest is totally gone. Anything else that happened
      that night is completely blacked out from my memory. </p><p>The next thing I
      remember is waking up alone in the Starlight Motel, sore from having had sex,
      without a phone, or a car, and, now, with night coming on.</p><p>I had no choice
      but to walk the half-mile from the motel to the fairgrounds, where I hoped my
      car would still be parked.</p><p>All the way there I still felt weirdly great.
      </p><p>I kept expecting a massive hangover to hit me, but it never came. I didn''t
      even have to pee, and I wasn''t really thirsty at all. I honestly don''t think
      I''d ever felt more rejuvenated in my life.</p><p>It was only when I reached
      the highway that I realized something was wrong. </p><p>It had to be the Saturday
      evening of fair weekend, but there wasn''t a single car on the road. </p><p>The
      traffic should have been bumper to bumper, even worse than it had been last
      night. Any other time of year, an empty highway would have been perfectly normal.
      But not tonight.</p><p>I walked faster. My footsteps through the gravel at the
      road''s shoulder was the only sound I could hear. It occurred to me, hurrying
      along while the sun sank into the mountains way off in the west, that I hadn''t
      seen a single person since I''d woken up. Not one.</p><p>The lights at the rodeo
      arena were on. And most of the street lights too. </p><p>But as I approached
      the fairgrounds, all of the carnival rides were totally dark. The Ferris wheel''s
      motionless silhouette rose up over the feedlot''s corrugated tin roof. There
      was no blaring carnival music, no roar of souped-up engines at the Saturday-night
      destruction derby, no cheers from the grandstands. </p><p>I hopped the fence
      into the parking lot. </p><p>There were only a few cars left. I was so relieved
      when I spotted my little gray sedan, parked all alone in the dimming evening
      light, that I practically ran to it. </p><p>I''d lost my set of keys along with
      my phone, but thank God Shawn had insisted that I keep a spare hidden under
      the battery. I popped the hood and found the extra key right where it should
      have been. </p><p>But the car door wasn''t locked. Which was odd, because if
      there was ever I time I''d be sure to lock my car door, it was during fair,
      especially if I''d parked in the public lot. </p><p>I wanted to get out of there
      as soon as I could and go home, or maybe to my parents'', or to Ian and Danielle''s,
      and to figure out what the fuck was going on. </p><p>I tried not to think about
      the unlocked door for now and I jammed the key into the ignition. Just as I
      put the car into drive I noticed something on the passenger seat.</p><p>It was
      a hoodie. A man''s. I kept my foot on the brake and held up the fabric. </p><p>It
      was Ian''s black Army hoodie. The one I''d seen him wearing at the bar. </p><p>So
      Ian had been in my car last night. </p><p>I tried again to think as hard as
      I could about what had happened after we were all at the bar. But it was no
      use. I had no memory whatsoever of anything after that.</p><p>In the dimming
      light I almost didn''t even see that there was something else on the seat. But
      when I moved the hoodie aside, there it was. </p><p>A gun. Ian''s gun. I recognized
      it right away. </p><p>It wasn''t like Ian was one of those guys who packed everywhere
      he went, but he must have been carrying it last night in the bar. And he must
      have had a reason. </p><p>But why would he have left his gun in my car? With
      the door unlocked? </p><p>I didn''t make sense. </p><p>Something was wrong.
      Something was really wrong. I had to get to Ian right away. I had to talk to
      him and find out what the hell was going on. </p><p>I hit the gas and drove
      my little car as fast as I could to toward the fairground''s nearest exit.</p><p>The
      exit was in the back, near the stockyard. On the way there I saw that everything
      at the carnival was totally shut down. All the food stalls were closed, and
      as far as I could tell, even the animals had been taken out of their pens. My
      headlights flooded the road and all of the motionless rides, but I didn''t see
      a single soul.</p><p>When I reached the gate, it was blocked. </p><p>A pair
      of wooden police barriers spanned the entire road. What the fuck was going on?</p><p>I
      almost screamed when someone knocked hard on my window.</p><p>"Ma''am?" It was
      a male voice, but it was too dark now to see who it was. Another couple of pounding
      knocks. "Can''t leave here, Ma''am."</p><p>It was a cop. He was knocking with
      his flashlight. I don''t know if I was more relieved that it was a cop and not
      someone trying to kill me or that it was simply another human being, the very
      first I''d seen that day. </p><p>I rolled down the window.</p><p>My eyes adjusted
      to the glare of the flashlight, and now I could see that the cop was Jason.
      Fucking great.</p><p>"I''m not authorized to let you through here, Ma''am."</p><p>"<i>Ma''am</i>?
      Who''s <i>Ma''am</i>? What the fuck, Jason?"</p><p>"Ashley. Whatever. You can''t
      pass through here." He was obviously still hung over, but this wasn''t stopping
      him from acting like an ass-hole cop now that he was on duty. "Vehicles can''t
      come or go until the search is over. Why are you even here? Why aren''t you
      at home?"</p><p>"I''m trying to <i>go</i> home," I said. "Just let me out."
      </p><p>"Can''t. Can''t let anyone in or out. We still haven''t caught those
      guys yet."</p><p>"What guys?"</p><p>"Are you kidding me?" Jason leaned casually
      against my car and folded his arms. This enraged me even further. "The guys
      who attacked that girl. Where have you been?"</p><p>Immediately my thoughts
      leapt to Haley. "What girl?" </p><p>"I don''t know." Jason shrugged. "Some girl.
      Some kid. It was two guys who did it. We''re still looking for them. We''re
      combing the fairgrounds. It''ll take a little time. The whole place is locked
      down. Here and the high school both. How do you not know about all this? Everyone
      was supposed to be out by two-thirty last night. They were announcing it for
      hours." Now he grinned that stupid smug grin of his. "Where were <i>you</i>?"
      He laughed. "You were fucking hammered last night! Having a little too much
      fun?" With this he gave a few rabbit-like thrusts of his pelvis. </p><p>I was
      too worried about Haley to care. </p><p>"Who was the girl, Jason? Just tell
      me who the girl was."</p><p>"I told you I don''t know, Ashley. Maybe if you
      weren''t so shitfaced last night you could have found out for yourself."</p><p>In
      the briefest of moments I thought about the gun under Ian''s hoodie. But I wasn''t
      stupid. </p><p>I had to focus on getting home as soon as possible, then calling
      Danielle on the landline. All I cared about right now was making sure that Haley
      was okay. I tried to remind myself that there were probably hundreds of little
      girls at the fair last night. But if something had happened to Haley after she''d
      begged me to take her to the carnival, and I wasn''t there, I''d have to kill
      myself.</p><p>I had to stay calm. I had to. I couldn''t afford anything else.</p><p>"Look,"
      I said to Jason, trying to control my voice. "You know me. I''m obviously not
      a suspect. All you have to do is move that roadblock and let me through."</p><p>Jason
      didn''t stop leaning against my car. </p><p>He grinned. Again.</p><p>"What''s
      the rush?" he said. "I mean, I can''t let you out. I told you that. And, hell,
      I sure could use some company." Now he leaned in closer and lowered his voice.
      "Here I am, stuck out here all alone on a chilly evening. What''s the hurry?"
      He winked. "It''d be just like old times."</p><p>"Let me the fuck out." It was
      everything I could do not to scream. "Right now. Jason. Let me the fuck out.
      There''s no way this is even legal. Let me the fuck out right now."</p><p>Jason
      put his head through the open window and brought it close to mine. He sniffed.</p><p>"You
      been drinking? Ashley? Are you still drunk, maybe?" Now he put his finger under
      my chin and turned my face around toward his. He sniffed again. "I wonder if
      maybe you''re getting just a little belligerent. I wouldn''t want to have to
      detain you. But if I have to, I have to. It''d be for you own good."</p><p>I
      couldn''t even think. I hadn''t ever been so enraged in my life. I just acted
      without planning. Suddenly I found that I''d slammed my foot into the gas pedal.</p><p>My
      car heaved forward. Jason spun around, and the next thing I saw of him was just
      his hand flopping out through the window. I''m not sure, but I may have broken
      his arm. </p><p>I didn''t have much time to wonder about it, though, because
      my bumper hit the two wooden police barricades. I lurched forward with the impact,
      and I worried for a moment that I might not make it through. But I just kept
      my foot on the gas, and my little car surged, knocked the barriers aside, and
      sent them tumbling onto the road. </p><p>I looked into the rear-view mirror.
      </p><p>My taillights were just bright enough to illuminate Jason limping forward.
      He raised his gun with one hand. I ducked and kept speeding forward as fast
      as my car would go. But I was already too far away; he lowered his gun without
      firing, and I turned the corner onto the completely empty highway.</p><p>I drove
      faster and faster, trying to catch my breath, maxing out at a little over ninety
      miles an hour. The road was completely empty. The night was completely dark.
      </p><p>And then I felt it: someone''s hand on my shoulder. </p><p>For a moment
      I tried to reason that this was impossible, that maybe my seat belt had tightened
      when I''d crashed through the barricades. But I wasn''t wearing my seat belt.
      </p><p>Someone really was in the back of my car&mdash;had <i>been</i> <i>in</i>
      the back of my car this whole time&mdash;and now they were touching my shoulder.
      </p><p>I felt an index finger slowly rise up the skin on my neck. Very lightly,
      it touched my ear.</p><p>I was driving way too fast to take my eyes off the
      road. My car was shuddering from the speed. Without really thinking about it,
      I held on tight to the wheel and reached for Ian''s gun. I felt its metallic
      grip at the tips of my fingers.</p><p>But I didn''t grab it. </p><p>And this
      is what''s really weird. This is what I still can''t figure out. Because more
      than anything else I was truly afraid that Haley had been hurt, or worse. I
      was also consumed by worry that I may have cheated on Shawn last night. And
      now I was truly, utterly terrified at the fact that someone was in the back
      of my car, running their finger along the softest part of my neck. And yet,
      despite all of this, that weirdly euphoric sensation of invincibility that had
      overcome me after waking up still hadn''t gone away. If anything, it was suddenly
      becoming more intense.</p><p>Whoever was behind me drew their hand down over
      my shoulder, slowly across my ribs and abdomen, then plunged it, very softly,
      into my underwear.</p><p>I still had no idea who it was, or how I could be so
      weirdly aroused at a moment like this. I flashed on dancing with Bryce Tripp
      last night, and lighting my cigarette from his, and his icy blue eyes, and I
      wondered if only someone as confident as he was could do anything so audacious
      as this.</p><p>And then I remembered something else while still trying to slow
      my car down without wrecking it. It hadn''t been Morgan who''d talked Ian into
      having one more shot with us, like I''d thought earlier. It had been <i>me</i>.
      Morgan had been goading him, but it wasn''t until <i>I''d</i> spoken up that
      Ian finally glanced in my direction, and, for just a moment, gave me this accidental
      look that seemed to say <i>I''d do anything you ask me to do, anything at all</i>.
      Then he drank down his second shot. </p><p>I took my hand from the gun. </p><p>Instead,
      I clutched the fabric of Ian''s hoodie in the seat beside me.</p><p>Whoever
      it was in the back seat of my car right now, reaching even deeper into my underwear
      while I tried to keep the car on the road, it was probably more likely that
      it was anyone in the world other than Ian. </p><p>And yet no matter how well
      I knew it couldn''t possibly be him, for a moment I <i>hoped</i> somehow that
      it was.</p>'

    - <p><span class="first_letter">I</span> really wasn't the kind of person who
      would ever act like this&mdash;or even think like this.</p><p>First of all,
      I wouldn't ever seriously consider sleeping around on my husband, even if maybe
      our marriage had fallen into a pretty deep rut. And I'm definitely not the kind
      of person who would ever actually get, well, just a little bit, um, wet, at
      the touch of a stranger's hand on my shoulder. It was true that I liked sex,
      just like everybody else does. And for a while I really liked it, especially
      with Shawn when we were younger and things had been going well between us and
      we were like best friends. But I wouldn't ever let anyone put their hand deep
      into my underwear while I was careening down a highway in the dark, probably
      not even Shawn in high school. And what I absolutely wouldn't ever do while
      a stranger's fingertip was beginning to press slightly inside me would be to
      actually hope that it was my sister's husband who was doing it. </p><p>Or at
      least I thought I wasn't that kind of person. Not until now. And I wasn't sure
      how I felt about it. </p><p>A voice whispered behind me. </p><p>It wasn't what
      I expected. It wasn't Ian's voice, that's for sure. And it definitely wasn't
      any guy I knew.</p><p>"You're <i>wet</i>," it said.</p><p>Then there was laughter.
      Shocked laughter. It was Morgan.</p><p>"Oh my God!" she said, no longer whispering
      and now laughing out loud. She jerked her hand out of my pants. "You actually
      got a little wet I think!" </p><p>Finally I was able to slow the car to a reasonable
      speed and I quickly turned my head, just enough to glimpse the outline of Morgan's
      face.</p><p>"What the fuck are you doing?" I snapped my head back around to
      keep my eyes on the road, then glanced in the rear-view mirror. "Morgan! What
      are you doing in my car?"</p><p>I was still so startled that I could barely
      process the fact that the person who had just had their hand down my pants had
      been my best friend. And it really weirded me out. So maybe one time at a lame-ass
      football party in high school some of the guys had pressured us into kissing
      each other, and we'd gone along just to prove we weren't prudes. But otherwise
      Morgan had never done anything like this.</p><p>She couldn't stop laughing.
      "Who did you think I was!"</p><p>"You scared the shit of me!" I said, trying
      to sound more annoyed than flustered and pretending I hadn't been turned on.
      "Morgan? What the hell? I almost wrecked the car! Your hands are like ice! What
      the fuck are you doing in here?"<p>

    - Going Down Six Feet Under
    - <p><span class="first_letter">I</span> held my hand up in front of my face.
      I moved my fingers.</p><p>I couldn't see anything at all. Nothing. I couldn't
      detect the slightest hint of movement. The darkness surrounding me was perfectly
      complete.</p><p>I tried to keep my breathing under control. The faster I breathed,
      the more oxygen I used up, and the less time I would have to live. </p><p>That's
      what I'd heard about being buried alive, anyway. I didn't see why it wouldn't
      be true.</p><p>Not that it really mattered whether I'd have just a few minutes
      to live or an hour. One way or another, this was it. I tried hard to accept
      the fact that I was going to die soon, that my life was going to end, that I
      was already beginning to suffocate. But it just didn't seem like it could be
      real, no matter how hard it was getting to breathe the air. </p><p>I reached
      out and touched the rough wood only a few inches in front of me. I could feel
      its raw, grainy texture. The scent of freshly-cut pine was overwhelming.</p><p>This
      was real.</p><p>When I was a kid I used to think that the most horrifying way
      to die would be to be buried alive. Worse than drowning, worse than getting
      killed in a car accident, worse even than being burned to death. The pain of
      burning would be unimaginably excruciating, I knew. But the horror wouldn't
      quite compare to suffocating inside a narrow, hot box beneath six feet of heavy
      dirt. </p><p>I even used to promise myself that I'd never get close to a coffin
      as long as I lived. Inviting even the remote possibility of ending up trapped
      inside one seemed like a stupid risk to take. </p><p>And yet somehow here I
      was. I'd let it happen.</p><p>I felt around for my cell phone and clicked it
      on. The screen's dim light glared. </p><p>The battery was now almost completely
      dead. I'd lost count of how many times I'd tried checking my phone for a signal.
      Nothing had changed; there was no service this far underground, and there wasn't
      ever going to be. </p><p>I clicked off the screen. </p><p>Once again I was lost
      in darkness.</p><br><p>It all started two days earlier when Morgan fell into
      a coma.</p><p>I don't know if it was because her mind just shut down from the
      trauma of being attacked by Mr. Hershel, or if it was because of some other
      reason which I didn't fully understand. But right after I saw her curled up
      in Ian's lap in my car, his arms holding her tightly and their lips somehow
      pressed together, Morgan convulsed briefly, then collapsed.</p><p>Ian tried
      to wake her.</p><p>"Morgan?" He shook her, and when she didn't wake he lightly
      slapped her face. "Morgan? Sweetheart, you need to stay with me! Morgan!"</p><p>But
      she wouldn't wake up. </p><p>I threw the spare clothes I'd grabbed into the
      back and squeezed beside Morgan, who was now lying slumped and unmoving in the
      passenger seat. </p><p>Ian raced us back to my parents' house. All the way there
      I did my best to keep talking to Morgan and calling her name into her ear, like
      Ian told me to do. But every time I gave her another series of brisk slaps,
      my best friend's head only rolled back down against her shoulder. </p><p>In
      the middle of all this, Ian tried to explain what I'd just seen going on between
      them. "I don't know what happened," he said. "I don't understand. I was trying
      to comfort her and suddenly her hands were all over me. And then she was kissing
      me. After everything she just went through." He shook his head emphatically.
      "I don't know why she would do something like that."</p><p>Everything about
      Ian's tone should have told me that he was telling the truth that Morgan had
      just started pressing her body against his and kissing him, out of the blue.
      But now, honestly, I couldn't be totally sure. The Ian I knew was an extremely
      honest person, but that didn't mean he was incapable of lying to me. I wasn't
      naive. After Morgan had told me at the fair that she was cheating on Jason with
      someone she couldn't name, and after I'd found Ian's hoodie and gun in my car
      where Morgan had slept, and after I'd just watched the way she'd been kissing
      him, I couldn't shake the idea that Morgan and Ian had been secretly sleeping
      together before all of this had started.</p><p>For now, I tried not think about
      it. Somehow I'd find out the truth later, but not now. More than anything else
      I was terrified that Morgan might die. She still wasn't waking up.</p>

    - Milk and Honey
    - <p><span class="first_letter">M</span>y phone's battery charge ticked down from
      two percent to one percent.</p><p>I shifted my weight and changed the angle
      of my head on Bryce's knee. I managed to find a slightly less cramped position.  </p><p><i>We're
      just in bed</i>, I kept trying to tell myself. <i>We're just in bed, under the
      covers, in a dark room. Soon, I'll just fall to sleep</i>.</p><p>I was scrolling
      through photos of my family. Any second now my phone's screen would switch off,
      and I wanted to see everyone one last time.</p><p>I was looking at Tyler and
      Haley in the photo I took of them before Tyler's first football game. He was
      lifting Haley off her feet, and they were both smiling ecstatically. I flipped
      to the next image. There was Shawn and me right after our wedding. He was thinner
      and looking happier than I'd seen him in a long time. Flip. There was my mom,
      knitting on the sofa. Flip. And there was my dad. He was fishing. He was sitting
      in the old lawn chair he always took to the river, gazing at the camera with
      the gentle look that was unique to my Dad.</p><p>I felt my chin start to quiver.
      Tears started to well in my eyes. I couldn't help it. Of all the people I'd
      never see again, I thought I'd miss my dad more than anyone else. I tried to
      cry quietly so Bryce wouldn't hear me.</p><p>I wiped my eyes with my shirt collar.
      When I opened them a text had appeared on the phone's screen.</p><p>Could this
      be possible? I looked at the cell reception meter. One tiny bar had appeared,
      then it quickly vanished. For a moment my phone must have got just enough reception
      for an old text to come through.</p><p>It was from Shawn:</p><br><p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;font-family:arial;font-size:.9em;"><i>i
      know where u r</i></p><p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;font-family:arial;font-size:.9em;"><i>why
      out there?</i></p>   <p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0;font-family:arial;font-size:.9em;"><i>r
      u with bryce t?</i></p><br><p>My eyes flashed over the text, then I read it
      over a second time. What did it mean? How could Shawn know where I was? Had
      he somehow traced my phone? Did he know I'd been buried alive? If so, what did
      he mean by "out there?" </p><p>My phone's screen went black. The battery was
      dead.</p>

    - Don't Catch the Plague
    - <p><span class="first_letter">M</span>y mom wouldn't stop knitting.</p><p>When
      I came in through the door, she said, "So you've decided to grace us with your
      presence."</p><p>She refused to look up from the scarf she was making for Haley.
      It had grown by an arm's length in the days I'd been gone.</p><p>All I'd wanted
      was come home to my parents' house, spend a semi-normal evening with my family,
      maybe have one of my mom's home-cooked meals, then actually sleep in a bed.
      I really needed some sanity after everything I'd been through. And considering
      that I was going to try to seduce and drug Jason Gibbs tomorrow, I was hoping
      to get some rest so I could prepare. </p><p>But apparently Shawn and the rest
      of Jason's squad had told my family that I was wanted for hiding infected refugees.
      They all thought that I'd been gone because I was keeping Morgan hidden from
      the Home Guard. I thought about telling them what had actually happened, but
      how could I? I didn't think anyone would really believe that I'd been buried
      alive and locked in a stripped-down U-Haul for the better part of a week.</p><p>"I
      don't see why you don't just tell them where Morgan is," my mom scolded. </p><p>I
      hadn't realized that she was in such deep denial about everything that was happening.
      </p><p>"They know what's best for her," she went on, fiercely knitting at the
      kitchen counter while she lectured me. "They're keeping us all safe. I don't
      know why you have to go and disrupt all of that. They're all such nice boys.
      And Shawn! You should be so proud of him! This has been so good for him. You
      need to be more grateful. We're all just so lucky that the good guys are on
      our side, watching out for us."</p><p>We'd missed dinner. Ian was having a beer
      with Bryce on the porch, and I'd told them that I'd make up some sandwiches.
      My dad was washing the dishes. As I opened the fridge, he dried his hands and
      put an arm around me.</p><p>"It's good to see you," he said, softly so my mom
      wouldn't hear him. "I was worried. I'm glad you're home."</p><p>At the dining
      table, Danielle was playing cards with Tyler and Haley. My sister hadn't said
      a word to me since I'd arrived at the house. When I went to grab the bread knife
      from the table, she scowled. She stood up, placing herself between me and her
      children, then she whispered fiercely into my ear.</p><p>"I know you know where
      that little bitch is," she hissed. "She's probably the one who brought that
      disease in from outside. You need to tell Ian where she is. No more fucking
      around."</p><p>I hadn't realized how much Ian wasn't telling Danielle. She didn't
      have a clue about what was going on. He obviously didn't trust her to keep the
      granary a secret. And judging by how my sister was acting now, he was absolutely
      right not to trust her. She wasn't ever the most easy-going of the two of us,
      but I'd never seen her behave this way. The stress was really getting to her,
      I could tell. Suddenly, it seemed, she hated me.</p><p>"Play with us, Aunt Ashley!"
      Haley peeked around her mother and looked at me expectantly.</p><p>Even after
      all I'd been through, I felt really bad having to say no to my niece yet again.
      </p><p>"Next time," I told her, mussing her hair. "I've got some important things
      to take care of. And we have a guest," I said, nodding in the direction of the
      porch.</p><p>Tyler couldn't have heard what his mother whispered into my ear,
      but he looked at both of us apprehensively. He was still in that awkward stage;
      he was probably going to be good looking when he got out of adolescence, but
      his nose had suddenly gotten to big for his face, and his forehead was ringed
      with acne from wearing his football helmet. Poor kid. He just wanted life to
      be normal, to play football, and to meet girls his age. He'd been helping Haley
      fan out the cards in her hand, and I could tell right away that he was terrified
      at everything that was happening, even though he was putting on a good face
      and trying to help his little sister through it. I think he just wanted everyone
      to stick together and make it out alive.</p><p>"Let's just leave Aunt Ashley
      alone for a little while," he said, avoiding Danielle's gaze. "She's probably
      starving."</p><p>It was true. I was famished. Other than the military rations
      that the Home Guard had delivered to the house, my parents seemed only to have
      an endless supply of roast beef and white bread. While I made a sandwich each
      for Ian, Bryce, and myself, I ate at least another sandwich's worth of the meat
      with my fingers. I still had a strange, insatiable craving for a hamburger and
      a milkshake, but instead I poured a big glass of milk and gulped it down. I
      hadn't craved milk like this since I was a kid, but I couldn't get enough of
      it. I poured a second glass.</p>

    - <p><span class="first_letter">F</span>rom my hiding place beside the highway,
      I heard someone approaching along the road.</p><p>The footsteps were slow and
      even, coming from way off in the distance. I sat up and stretched my back, making
      sure to keep low enough so that I would still be concealed behind the gully's
      rocks and brush. </p><p>It was dawn. </p><p>I was still cold, but not as miserably
      cold as I'd been all night. The sun was about to rise over the plains. I could
      see now that the leaves of the cottonwoods I'd been sleeping under were beginning
      to turn from green to yellow. But as I peered through the branches and searched
      the highway, I still couldn't see who was coming. The person was still on the
      far side of the bend in the road and concealed by the hillside.</p><p>But they
      were definitely getting closer. Now I could hear what sounded like something
      being dragged. With every other footstep came the sound of a chain clinking
      across the road's dry asphalt.</p><p>Finally a tiny figure emerged from around
      the bend. I looked around at my hiding spot in the gully, making sure that I
      was still concealed from the highway now that it was daylight. I was sitting
      within steps of the road, but I was pretty sure whoever was coming wouldn't
      be able to see me behind the cover of sage and low cottonwood branches. </p><p>It
      was a girl. </p><p>This came as a surprise, because the dragging chain sounded
      heavy. But the girl was walking with a slow, even pace. She didn't appear to
      be struggling at all. She just took one step accompanied by the dragging sound,
      then another quiet step, followed again by another step with the dragging sound.</p><p>As
      she drew closer, I could tell that she was only about eleven or twelve years
      old. </p><p>I didn't recognize her. She must have been someone from out of town.
      She had long brown hair, pulled back behind her ears, and she was wearing a
      dress. The dress looked like something she could have worn to a wedding, or
      maybe to church, except that it was filthy. What had once been white fabric
      had now soiled to a dull gray, closely matching the color of her equally filthy
      skin.</p><p>This uniform filth was probably why I didn't notice immediately
      that her dress was torn. The entire front section had been ripped away, revealing
      everything bellow her belly button. And she wasn't wearing any underwear. </p><p>My
      heart started to race. </p><p>As the girl came closer, I could see that her
      eyes were a beautiful green, but they were deeply sunken. And she was incredibly
      thin. Her hip bones jutted sharply from her waist. And yet her expression was
      perfectly calm. She was just staring straight ahead, keeping an even pace as
      she made her way down the empty road. She behaved as if she was perfectly clean
      and healthy, as if her dress was perfectly in tact, and as if her bare genitalia
      wasn't exposed for all the world to see.</p><p>And also as if nothing was attached
      to her foot. </p><p>I could see now that a steel animal trap was clamped around
      her ankle. Her foot was badly broken and twisted unnaturally. The trap's serrated
      jaws had dug through her skin, revealing her bone. Her toes were blackened and
      heavily swollen. Six feet of chain trailed behind her heel, and yet she was
      barely limping at all. </p><p>"Hey!" I shouted. I stepped out from the behind
      the brush. "Are you okay? You need help!"</p><p>The girl didn't respond. I clambered
      down the gully and onto the road. </p><p>"Stop!" I was close enough to her now
      to hear her steady breathing. "You need help. Sweetie, where are you parents?
      Stop!"</p><p>She didn't slow her pace. I actually had to step out of the way
      so she wouldn't bump into me. She just kept her gaze pointed at the far end
      of the road where it turned around the next bend. </p><p>I could smell her.
      Her foot was gangrenous. She smelled rotten. </p><p>She kept walking, and I
      didn't follow after her. She just kept marching casually onward, mostly naked,
      dragging the trap with her broken foot. The sound of the chain's jangling grew
      fainter as she moved on.</p><p>What else could I do?

    - <p><span class="first_letter">I</span> woke up to the sound of clucking chickens.</p><p>It
      was morning. My head was still so foggy from the sedatives I could hardly lift
      it to get a good look around.</p><p>I was in the chicken stall at the fair grounds.
      The rows of cages were still filled with birds that had been entered into the
      now-abandoned fair. They were starving, and molting. Some were dead. I was covered
      in loose hay and feathers. </p><p>Somehow, I was still holding on to half of
      Morgan's flannel shirt and Jason's wallet. I forced myself to sit up.</p><p>I
      had no memory of making it as far as the fairgrounds before passing out. I was
      still naked. My bare feet were cut and covered in dried blood. </p><p>I opened
      Jason's wallet. I threw out a debit card and some kind of Home Guard mess hall
      card. And then there it was. A simple white card with a magnetic strip, the
      words "Pharmaceutical Access," and a warning that finding it and not returning
      it to the Home Guard was a crime punishable by indefinite detention.</p><p>I
      kept the card and tossed Jason's wallet into one of the chicken cages. </p><p>I
      felt inside the breast pocket of what was left of Morgan's flannel. The single
      quarter I'd saved was still inside.</p><p>I crept from the chicken stall out
      into the sun. The morning was surprisingly warm after a cold night. The fair
      grounds were totally abandoned, and for a moment I just let the sunlight fall
      onto my naked body. I was still feeling pretty woozy, but I could feel some
      of my energy start to return. </p><p>I looked out toward the fields stretching
      away from the chicken stall. As far as I could see, Jason's SUV was gone. </p><p>The
      fair grounds, luckily, were filled with pay phones. The nearest was just across
      the roadway beside the horse stables. </p><p>I'd torn up Chris's letter after
      memorizing his number, but I was able to clear the cobwebs from my head just
      enough to remember the digits as I deposited the quarter. </p><p>Chris picked
      up right away.</p><p>"Please tell me this is Ashley," he said. He must not have
      recognized the incoming number and hoped it was a pay phone. "Is this Ashley?"</p><p>"I
      got it," I said. I told him where I was and asked him to pick me up. "Bring
      me some clothes, will you?" I added. "Don't ask. It's a long story."</p><p>While
      I waited for Chris, I found a relatively concealed place in the sun behind a
      wooden barrel that had been converted into a flower pot. I listened to the horses
      in their stalls, whinnying loudly. Poor things. They probably hadn't a heard
      a human voice for days, and they were probably starving. </p><p>I car approached.
      </p><p>I ducked down behind the flower pot and peered over its arrangement of
      dead pansies. </p><p>A hearse, covered in dust, pulled up in front of the stables.
      It came to a stop by the pay phone. Its engine cut.</p><p>Chris stepped out.
      He was in a white Home Guard uniform and a lab coat with two armbands, one with
      a black HG logo and the other with a red cross.</p><p>"Don't ask about the car
      and I won't ask about the clothes," he said, tossing a small duffel bag behind
      the flower pot. It landed by my bloodied foot. I unzipped it.</p>
